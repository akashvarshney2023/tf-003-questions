Sentinel enforces policy logic during the plan phase in a Terraform Cloud run. 

Here's the sequence of events in a Terraform Cloud run:

1. **Terraform Initialization (`terraform init`)**: Sets up the working directory for use with Terraform.
2. **Terraform Planning (`terraform plan`)**: Generates an execution plan showing the changes that will be made to achieve the desired state.
3. **Sentinel Policy Check**: Evaluates the generated plan against defined Sentinel policies. This happens **after the plan phase** but **before the apply phase**.
4. **Terraform Apply (`terraform apply`)**: Executes the actions proposed in the plan to achieve the desired state.

So, the Sentinel policy logic is enforced after the plan is created but before any changes are applied to the infrastructure. This ensures that any policy violations are caught before making any changes, preventing non-compliant modifications from being applied.
