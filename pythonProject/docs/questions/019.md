## If you update the version constraint in your Terraform configuration, Terraform will update your lock file the next time you run terraform Init.

- True
- False

---

**False**

### Explanation:

When you update the version constraint in your Terraform configuration, Terraform does not automatically update the lock file (`.terraform.lock.hcl`) the next time you run `terraform init`. The lock file (`.terraform.lock.hcl`) is used to lock the provider versions to ensure consistent deployments. 

Hereâ€™s what happens in detail:

1. **Updating Version Constraints**:
   - When you update the version constraints for a provider in your Terraform configuration file, Terraform will not immediately update the lock file. The lock file will only be updated if there is a change in the provider versions.

2. **Running `terraform init`**:
   - The `terraform init` command initializes the working directory, downloads the required providers, and sets up the backend. If the lock file is already present and the version constraints in the configuration file have changed, Terraform will check if the current lock file satisfies the new constraints.
   - If the lock file is out of sync with the updated version constraints, you need to explicitly update the lock file using `terraform init -upgrade`.

3. **Updating the Lock File**:
   - To update the lock file to reflect the new version constraints, you should run:

     ```sh
     terraform init -upgrade
     ```

   - This command forces Terraform to upgrade the provider versions to match the new version constraints and update the lock file accordingly.

### Summary:

- **False**: Updating the version constraint in the Terraform configuration does not automatically update the lock file. You need to run `terraform init -upgrade` to explicitly update the lock file to reflect new version constraints.
