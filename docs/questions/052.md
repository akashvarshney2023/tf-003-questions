# Referencing Resources with for_each and Splat Expressions in Terraform

## Question

You can reference a resource created with for_each using a Splat (*) expression.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Explanation

**False**

**Explanation:** In Terraform, when you use the `for_each` meta-argument to create multiple instances of a resource, each instance is identified by a unique key in a map. These instances cannot be referenced using a Splat (`*`) expression. Instead, you need to reference them by their specific keys.

For example, consider the following resource block using `for_each`:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  for_each = {
    instance1 = "ami-123456"
    instance2 = "ami-789012"
  }

  ami           = each.value
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

To reference these instances, you need to use their keys explicitly:

```hcl
aws_instance.example["instance1"]
aws_instance.example["instance2"]
```

The Splat expression (`*`) is used for referencing all elements in a list or map, but it is not suitable for resources created with `for_each`. Instead, you use the keys of the map to access specific instances. The correct usage would involve either iterating over the keys or referencing each instance directly by its key.

### Summary

The statement "You can reference a resource created with for_each using a Splat (*) expression" is false. Instead, you reference these resources by their specific keys in the map.
