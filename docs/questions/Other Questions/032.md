# Using Different Terraform Commands for Cloud Providers

## Question
You must use different Terraform commands depending on the cloud provider you use.

- [ ] True
- [ ] False

## Answer

### **False**

**Explanation**:
Terraform commands are consistent across all cloud providers. The same set of commands such as `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, `terraform destroy`, etc., are used regardless of the cloud provider. The difference lies in the provider-specific configurations and resource definitions within the Terraform configuration files.

For example, whether you are using AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or any other supported provider, the process for managing infrastructure with Terraform remains the same:

1. **Initialization**: `terraform init` initializes the configuration and downloads the necessary provider plugins.
2. **Planning**: `terraform plan` creates an execution plan, showing what actions Terraform will take to achieve the desired state.
3. **Applying**: `terraform apply` applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration.
4. **Destroying**: `terraform destroy` destroys the resources defined in the configuration.

What changes between cloud providers are the provider blocks and the resource definitions within the `.tf` files. Each cloud provider has its own set of supported resources and required configurations, but the core Terraform commands remain the same.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Summary

Terraform commands do not change depending on the cloud provider you use. The commands remain consistent, while the configuration details within the Terraform files differ based on the provider.
