# TF_LOG Environment Variable in Terraform

## Question

Setting the TF_LOG environment variable to DEBUG causes debug messages to be logged into stdout.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Explanation

**False**

**Explanation:** Setting the `TF_LOG` environment variable to `DEBUG` in Terraform does not cause debug messages to be logged into `stdout` (standard output). Instead, it directs debug messages to `stderr` (standard error). This distinction is important for separating debug output from regular command output, especially in automated or scripted environments.

### Example

If you set `TF_LOG=DEBUG` and run a Terraform command like `terraform apply`, debug messages will be printed to `stderr`. Here's an example:

```bash
$ TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform apply

2024/07/19 12:34:56 [DEBUG] Using modified User-Agent: Terraform/1.0.0 (linux/amd64)
2024/07/19 12:34:57 [DEBUG] Reading state from state file
2024/07/19 12:34:58 [DEBUG] Refreshing state...
...
```

### Summary

The statement "Setting the TF_LOG environment variable to DEBUG causes debug messages to be logged into stdout" is false. Debug messages are logged into `stderr` when `TF_LOG` is set to `DEBUG` in Terraform.
