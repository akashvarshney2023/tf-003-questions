### Which of the following are advantages of using infrastructure as code (laC) instead of provisioning with a graphical user interface (GUI)? Choose two correct answers.

- Lets you version, reuse, and share infrastructure configuration
- Provisions the same resources at a lower cost
- Secures your credentials
- Reduces risk of operator error
- Prevents manual modifications to your resources

The two correct advantages of using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) instead of provisioning with a graphical user interface (GUI) are:

1. **Lets you version, reuse, and share infrastructure configuration**:
   - IaC allows you to store your infrastructure configurations in version control systems (VCS) such as Git. This enables you to track changes over time, collaborate with others, reuse configurations across projects, and share them easily.

2. **Reduces risk of operator error**:
   - By using IaC, you define your infrastructure through code, which reduces the risk of human errors that can occur when manually provisioning resources through a GUI. IaC scripts can be reviewed, tested, and automated, leading to more consistent and reliable infrastructure deployments.

### Why Not the Other Options?

- **Provisions the same resources at a lower cost**:
  - IaC does not inherently change the cost of the resources. The cost is determined by the cloud provider and the resources used, regardless of whether they are provisioned via IaC or a GUI.

- **Secures your credentials**:
  - While IaC can help manage and securely store configurations, securing credentials specifically depends on how they are managed (e.g., using secret management tools). IaC itself does not inherently secure credentials.

- **Prevents manual modifications to your resources**:
  - IaC encourages managing infrastructure through code, but it does not prevent manual modifications. However, making manual changes is discouraged because it can lead to configuration drift and inconsistencies with the IaC-defined state.
