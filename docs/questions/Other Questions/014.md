### How can you trigger a run in a Terraform Cloud workspace that is connected to a Version Control System (VCS) repository?

- Only Terraform Cloud organization owners can set workspace variables on VCS connected workspaces
- Commit a change to the VCS working directory and branch that the Terraform Cloud workspace is connected to
- Only Terraform Cloud organization owners can approve plans in VCS connected workspaces
- Only members of a VCS organization can open a pull request against repositories that are connected to Terraform Cloud workspaces

To trigger a run in a Terraform Cloud workspace that is connected to a Version Control System (VCS) repository, you should:

- **Commit a change to the VCS working directory and branch that the Terraform Cloud workspace is connected to**

### Explanation:
When a Terraform Cloud workspace is connected to a VCS repository, it is set up to trigger runs automatically based on changes to the repository. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **Commit Changes**: Any commits pushed to the branch that the workspace is connected to will automatically trigger a new run in Terraform Cloud. This ensures that your infrastructure is updated in response to changes in your configuration files.

### Why Not the Other Options?

- **Only Terraform Cloud organization owners can set workspace variables on VCS connected workspaces**:
  - While organization owners have special permissions, this option is not related to triggering runs. Setting workspace variables does not trigger runs by itself.

- **Only Terraform Cloud organization owners can approve plans in VCS connected workspaces**:
  - This is incorrect; plan approval can be configured to be required for all users with the appropriate permissions, not just organization owners. However, this is related to approvals and not triggering runs.

- **Only members of a VCS organization can open a pull request against repositories that are connected to Terraform Cloud workspaces**:
  - This is not directly related to triggering runs. Opening pull requests is a VCS operation, and while it can impact the state of the branch, it does not directly trigger runs. The trigger is based on commits and branch changes.

Thus, the correct method to trigger a run in a VCS-connected Terraform Cloud workspace is to commit a change to the branch that the workspace is monitoring.
