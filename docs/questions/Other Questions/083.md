# Terraform Blocks for Nested Configurations

## Question

What type of block is used to construct a collection of nested configuration blocks?

- [ ] Dynamic
- [ ] For_each
- [ ] Nesting
- [ ] Repeated

## Explanation

**Dynamic**

**Explanation:** The **`dynamic`** block is used to construct a collection of nested configuration blocks in Terraform. It allows you to generate multiple nested blocks within a resource or module dynamically based on a set of values or conditions. This is particularly useful when the number of nested blocks or their content depends on variable data.

**Other Options:**

- **For_each:** This meta-argument is used for creating multiple instances of a resource or module based on a collection of values. While it helps in iterating over items, it is not specifically used for generating nested blocks.

- **Nesting:** This term is not a specific Terraform block type but rather a concept referring to placing blocks within other blocks. Terraform uses the `dynamic` block for generating nested configurations programmatically.

- **Repeated:** This is not a valid block type in Terraform. The concept of repetition in Terraform configurations is typically handled by `for_each` or `count`, not by a block called "repeated."

### Summary

The **`dynamic`** block is used to construct a collection of nested configuration blocks in Terraform, allowing for flexible and programmatic generation of configuration content.
