# Deleting a Newly-Created VM with Terraform

## Question
You have never used Terraform before and would like to test it out using a shared team account for a cloud provider. The shared team account already contains 15 virtual machines (VMs). You develop a Terraform configuration containing one VM, perform `terraform apply`, and see that your VM was created successfully.
What should you do to delete the newly-created VM with Terraform?

- [ ] The Terraform state file contains all 16 VMs in the team account. Execute `terraform destroy` and select the newly-created VM.
- [ ] Delete the Terraform state file and execute `terraform apply`.
- [ ] The Terraform state file only contains the one new VM. Execute `terraform destroy`.
- [ ] Delete the VM using the cloud provider console and `terraform apply` to apply the changes to the Terraform state file.

## Answer

### **The Terraform state file only contains the one new VM. Execute `terraform destroy`.**

**Explanation**:
When you apply a Terraform configuration, Terraform maintains a state file that tracks the infrastructure resources it manages. In your case, since you only included one VM in your Terraform configuration, the Terraform state file will only contain information about that one VM.

To delete the newly-created VM, you should use the `terraform destroy` command. This command will read the state file, identify the resources managed by Terraform (in this case, just the one VM), and then destroy those resources.

Here are the options explained:

- **The Terraform state file contains all 16 VMs in the team account. Execute `terraform destroy` and select the newly-created VM.**:
  This is incorrect. The Terraform state file only includes the resources that Terraform is managing, not all existing
