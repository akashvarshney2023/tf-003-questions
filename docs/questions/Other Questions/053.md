# Applying Terraform Plans

## Question

Only the user that generated a plan may apply it.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Explanation

**False**

**Explanation:** In Terraform, the process of generating and applying plans is not restricted to the user who generated the plan. Any user with the appropriate permissions can apply a Terraform plan that was generated by another user. 

Here’s a more detailed explanation:

1. **Plan and Apply Workflow**:
    - **terraform plan**: This command is used to generate an execution plan, which shows what actions Terraform will take to achieve the desired state as described in the configuration files.
    - **terraform apply**: This command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration. The `apply` command can use a previously saved plan file.

2. **Plan File**:
    - When you run `terraform plan -out=tfplan`, Terraform saves the plan to a file named `tfplan`.
    - This plan file can then be shared with other users or systems.

3. **Permissions**:
    - The ability to apply a plan is governed by the permissions of the user applying the plan. As long as the user has the necessary permissions to access the state and the resources, they can apply a plan file generated by someone else.

4. **Collaboration**:
    - In team environments, it's common for one user to generate a plan and another to apply it, especially in CI/CD pipelines or when following approval processes.

Here’s an example scenario:

1. **User A** runs:
    ```bash
    terraform plan -out=tfplan
    ```

2. **User B** can then run:
    ```bash
    terraform apply tfplan
    ```

As long as **User B** has the required permissions, they can apply the plan generated by **User A**.

### Summary

The statement "Only the user that generated a plan may apply it" is false. Any user with the appropriate permissions can apply a Terraform plan generated by another user.
