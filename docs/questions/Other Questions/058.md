# Adding Existing Resources to Terraform State

## Question

Which command adds existing resources into Terraform state?

- [ ] Terraform init
- [ ] Terraform plan
- [ ] Terraform refresh
- [x] Terraform import
- [ ] All of these

## Explanation

**Terraform init**

**Explanation:** The `terraform init` command initializes a Terraform working directory. It sets up the backend, installs required provider plugins, and prepares the directory for other Terraform operations. It does not add existing resources to the Terraform state.

**Terraform plan**

**Explanation:** The `terraform plan` command creates an execution plan showing what actions Terraform will take to achieve the desired state defined in the configuration files. It does not modify the Terraform state or add existing resources to it.

**Terraform refresh**

**Explanation:** The `terraform refresh` command updates the Terraform state file with the latest information from the real infrastructure. This command reconciles the state file with the actual infrastructure but does not add new resources to the state.

**Terraform import**

**Explanation:** The `terraform import` command is used to add existing infrastructure resources to the Terraform state. It allows Terraform to manage resources that were created outside of Terraform by importing them into the state file. This is the correct command for adding existing resources to Terraform state.

**All of these**

**Explanation:** Since only `terraform import` is specifically used to add existing resources into the Terraform state, this option is not correct.

### Summary

The correct command to add existing resources into Terraform state is **`terraform import`**. The other commands listed perform different functions related to initializing, planning, and refreshing Terraform configurations and state.
