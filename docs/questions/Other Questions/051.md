# Managing Authentication for Remote Backends in Terraform

## Question

When you use a remote backend that needs authentication, HashiCorp recommends that you:

- [ ] Write the authentication credentials in the Terraform configuration files
- [ ] Keep the Terraform configuration files in a secret store
- [ ] Push your Terraform configuration to an encrypted git repository
- [x] Use partial configuration to load the authentication credentials outside of the Terraform code

## Explanation

### Write the authentication credentials in the Terraform configuration files

**Explanation:** This approach is not recommended. Including authentication credentials directly in Terraform configuration files can lead to security risks, as these files might be exposed to unauthorized access, especially if they are stored in version control systems.

### Keep the Terraform configuration files in a secret store

**Explanation:** Keeping the entire Terraform configuration in a secret store is not a practical approach. While secret stores are useful for managing sensitive information, Terraform configurations are typically version-controlled and shared among team members. The focus should be on securing the sensitive parts (such as credentials) rather than the entire configuration.

### Push your Terraform configuration to an encrypted git repository

**Explanation:** Encrypting the git repository adds a layer of security, but it does not directly address the issue of how to securely manage and load authentication credentials within Terraform configurations. Sensitive data should be managed using more specific solutions designed for secret management.

### Use partial configuration to load the authentication credentials outside of the Terraform code

**Explanation:** This is the recommended approach by HashiCorp. Using partial configuration allows you to separate the sensitive authentication credentials from the main Terraform configuration files. This way, credentials can be managed securely using environment variables, secret management tools, or external files that are not checked into version control. Here's an example of how to use partial configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    # Configuration parameters without sensitive information
  }
}
```

And then use environment variables or a separate file to provide the credentials:

```bash
export TF_VAR_backend_config_file=./backend-config.tfvars
terraform init -backend-config=$TF_VAR_backend_config_file
```

### Summary

To securely manage authentication credentials for remote backends, HashiCorp recommends using **partial configuration** to load the credentials outside of the Terraform code. This practice helps keep sensitive information secure and separate from the main configuration files.
