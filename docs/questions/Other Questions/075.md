# Accessing Resource Details in Terraform

## Question

Which of the following commands would be used to access all of the attributes and details of a resource managed by Terraform?

- [ ] `terraform state show provider_type_name`
- [ ] `terraform state list`
- [ ] `terraform get provider_type_name`
- [x] `terraform state show provider_type_name`

## Explanation

**`terraform state show provider_type_name`**

**Explanation:** The command **`terraform state show provider_type_name`** is used to display detailed information about a specific resource managed by Terraform. It provides all attributes and details of the resource as recorded in the Terraform state file. The `provider_type_name` should be replaced with the specific resource type and name.

**Other Options:**

- **`terraform state list`**: This command lists all resources in the current state file but does not provide detailed attributes or information about a specific resource.

- **`terraform get provider_type_name`**: This command does not exist in Terraform CLI. The `terraform get` command is used to download and update modules, not to show resource details.

- **`terraform state list provider_type_name`**: This command is incorrect as `terraform state list` does not take resource identifiers as arguments. It only lists resource names without showing detailed information.

### Summary

To access all of the attributes and details of a resource managed by Terraform, you should use **`terraform state show provider_type_name`**, replacing `provider_type_name` with the specific resource identifier.
