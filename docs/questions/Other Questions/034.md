# Best Time to Run `terraform validate`

## Question
You are making changes to existing Terraform code to add some new infrastructure.
When is the best time to run `terraform validate`?

- [ ] After you run `terraform apply` so you can validate your infrastructure
- [ ] Before you run `terraform apply` so you can validate your provider credentials
- [ ] Before you run `terraform plan` so you can validate your code syntax
- [ ] After you run `terraform plan` so you can validate that your state file is consistent with your infrastructure

## Answer

### **Before you run `terraform plan` so you can validate your code syntax**

**Explanation**:
The `terraform validate` command is used to validate the syntax and configuration of your Terraform code. It checks whether the configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent, without needing to access any remote services such as cloud provider APIs. This is crucial for catching syntax errors and basic configuration issues early in the development process.

Running `terraform validate` before `terraform plan` ensures that any syntax errors or misconfigurations are detected before Terraform attempts to create an execution plan. This helps to avoid wasting time and resources on planning and applying changes with invalid configurations.

- [ ] After you run `terraform apply` so you can validate your infrastructure
- [ ] Before you run `terraform apply` so you can validate your provider credentials
- [x] Before you run `terraform plan` so you can validate your code syntax
- [ ] After you run `terraform plan` so you can validate that your state file is consistent with your infrastructure

## Summary

The best time to run `terraform validate` is before you run `terraform plan` so you can validate your code syntax. This ensures that your configuration is correct and ready for further planning and applying stages, preventing potential issues early in the workflow.
