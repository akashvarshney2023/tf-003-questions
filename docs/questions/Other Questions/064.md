# Impact of Ticket-Based Systems on Infrastructure Provisioning and Scaling

## Question

How can a ticket-based system slow down infrastructure provisioning and limit the ability to scale? Choose two correct answers.

- [x] End-users have to request infrastructure changes
- [ ] Ticket-based systems generate a full audit trail of the request and fulfillment process
- [ ] Users can access a catalog of approved resources from a drop-down list in a request form
- [x] The more resources your organization needs, the more tickets your infrastructure team has to process

## Explanation

**End-users have to request infrastructure changes**

**Explanation:** In a ticket-based system, end-users must submit requests for infrastructure changes, which then need to be reviewed and fulfilled by the infrastructure team. This process introduces delays because it adds a manual step to the provisioning workflow, which can slow down the overall speed of infrastructure deployment.

**The more resources your organization needs, the more tickets your infrastructure team has to process**

**Explanation:** As the demand for infrastructure grows, the number of tickets the infrastructure team needs to process increases proportionally. This can lead to bottlenecks and delays, as the team must handle a larger volume of requests, which can limit the organization's ability to scale efficiently.

**Ticket-based systems generate a full audit trail of the request and fulfillment process**

**Explanation:** While generating an audit trail is useful for compliance and tracking purposes, it does not directly contribute to slowing down provisioning or limiting scalability. In fact, having a detailed audit trail can be beneficial for understanding and improving processes.

**Users can access a catalog of approved resources from a drop-down list in a request form**

**Explanation:** Providing a catalog of approved resources helps streamline the request process by standardizing available options, which can reduce errors and speed up the request process. This feature does not slow down provisioning or limit scalability; rather, it helps manage requests more efficiently.

### Summary

The two factors that can slow down infrastructure provisioning and limit scalability in a ticket-based system are:
- **End-users have to request infrastructure changes**, introducing delays due to manual processes.
- **The more resources your organization needs, the more tickets your infrastructure team has to process**, leading to increased processing times and potential bottlenecks.
