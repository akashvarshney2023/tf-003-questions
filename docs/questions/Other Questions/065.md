# Terraform Behavior After Removing Resource Definitions

## Question

You have a Terraform configuration that defines a single virtual machine with no references to it. You have run `terraform apply` to create the resource, and then removed the resource definition from your Terraform configuration file. What will happen when you run `terraform apply` in the working directory again?

- [ ] Terraform will remove the virtual machine from the state file, but the resource will still exist
- [ ] Nothing
- [ ] Terraform will error
- [x] Terraform will destroy the virtual machine

## Explanation

**Terraform will destroy the virtual machine**

**Explanation:** When you remove a resource definition from your Terraform configuration and run `terraform apply`, Terraform will perform a diff between the current state and the updated configuration. Since the resource is no longer defined in the configuration, Terraform will recognize that the resource is no longer part of the desired state. Consequently, Terraform will plan to destroy the resource to align the infrastructure with the updated configuration.

Hereâ€™s what happens in detail:

1. **Configuration Changes:** The resource definition is removed from the configuration files, meaning Terraform no longer knows about or manages that resource.
2. **State Comparison:** During the `terraform apply` operation, Terraform compares the current state (which includes the virtual machine) with the new configuration (which does not include the virtual machine).
3. **Resource Destruction:** Terraform detects that the virtual machine is present in the state but not in the configuration, so it will create a plan to destroy the virtual machine to reconcile the state with the updated configuration.

**Other Options:**

- **Terraform will remove the virtual machine from the state file, but the resource will still exist:** Terraform will indeed remove the resource from the state file, but it will do so as part of the destroy operation, which will also delete the resource.
- **Nothing:** Terraform will not perform no action; it will act based on the changes in the configuration.
- **Terraform will error:** Terraform does not error simply because a resource is removed from the configuration; it performs a destroy action if necessary.

### Summary

When you run `terraform apply` after removing a resource definition from the configuration file, Terraform will destroy the virtual machine to synchronize the state with the updated configuration.
