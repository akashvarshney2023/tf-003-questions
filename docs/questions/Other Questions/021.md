## What does Terraform use the .terraform.lock.hc1 file for?

- [ ] There is no such file
- [ ] Tracking specific provider dependencies
- [ ] Preventing Terraform runs from occurring
- [ ] Storing references to workspaces which are locked
---

Sure, here are the explanations for each option:

- [ ] **There is no such file**
  - This option is incorrect. The `.terraform.lock.hcl` file is a legitimate file created by Terraform.

- [x] **Tracking specific provider dependencies**
  - This is the correct option. The `.terraform.lock.hcl` file locks the versions of the providers that are being used to ensure consistent behavior across different runs and environments.

- [ ] **Preventing Terraform runs from occurring**
  - This option is incorrect. The `.terraform.lock.hcl` file does not prevent Terraform runs. Instead, it ensures that the same versions of providers are used every time `terraform init` is run.

- [ ] **Storing references to workspaces which are locked**
  - This option is incorrect. The `.terraform.lock.hcl` file does not store references to workspaces. Workspaces and their states are managed separately within Terraform's state files and configuration.
