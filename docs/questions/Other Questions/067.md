# Parameters Required by Terraform Import

## Question

Which parameters does `terraform import` require? Choose two correct answers.

- [ ] Provider
- [x] Resource ID
- [x] Resource address
- [ ] Path

## Explanation

**Resource ID**

**Explanation:** The `terraform import` command requires the **Resource ID**, which is the unique identifier for the resource in the external system. This ID allows Terraform to map the resource from the provider to the Terraform state.

**Resource address**

**Explanation:** The `terraform import` command also requires the **Resource address**, which specifies the type and name of the resource within the Terraform configuration. This address tells Terraform where to map the imported resource in the state file.

**Provider**

**Explanation:** The `terraform import` command does not explicitly require the provider to be specified as part of the command. Instead, the provider is defined in the Terraform configuration files, and the import process uses this configuration to understand how to interact with the external system.

**Path**

**Explanation:** The `terraform import` command does not use a path parameter. The command focuses on the resource address and the resource ID to perform the import operation.

### Summary

The `terraform import` command requires the **Resource ID** and the **Resource address**. The provider and path are not directly required parameters for the import process.
