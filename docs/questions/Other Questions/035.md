# Referencing Volume IDs in Terraform Configuration

## Question
How would you reference the volume IDs associated with the `ebs_block_device` blocks in this configuration?

- [ ] `aws_instance.example.ebs_block_device[sda2,sda3).volume_id`
- [ ] `aws_instance.example.ebs_block_device.[*].volume_id`
- [ ] `aws_instance.example.ebs_block_device.volume_ids`
- [ ] `aws_instance.example.ebs_block_device.*.volume_id`

## Answer

### **`aws_instance.example.ebs_block_device.*.volume_id`**

**Explanation**:
In Terraform, to reference multiple instances of a nested block within a resource, you can use the `*` operator. This operator is used to iterate over all instances of the nested block and retrieve a specific attribute from each instance.

Given the Terraform configuration:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-abc123"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  ebs_block_device {
    device_name = "sda2"
    volume_size = 16
  }

  ebs_block_device {
    device_name = "sda3"
    volume_size = 20
  }
}
