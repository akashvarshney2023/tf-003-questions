# Terraform Destroy Behavior

## Question

You have created a `main.tf` Terraform configuration consisting of an application server, a database, and a load balancer. You ran `terraform apply` and Terraform created all of the resources successfully. Now you realize that you do not actually need the load balancer, so you run `terraform destroy` without any flags. What will happen?

- [ ] Terraform will prompt you to pick which resource you want to destroy
- [ ] Terraform will destroy the application server because it is listed first in the code
- [x] Terraform will prompt you to confirm that you want to destroy all the infrastructure
- [ ] Terraform will destroy the main.tf file
- [ ] Terraform will immediately destroy all the infrastructure

## Explanation

**Terraform will prompt you to confirm that you want to destroy all the infrastructure**

**Explanation:** When you run `terraform destroy` without any additional flags, Terraform will prompt you to confirm that you want to destroy all the resources managed by the Terraform configuration. This prompt ensures that you are aware of the impact of the command before it proceeds with the destruction of the infrastructure.

Hereâ€™s a typical sequence of events:

1. **Prompt for Confirmation:** Terraform will output a plan of what will be destroyed and ask for confirmation. You will need to type `yes` to proceed with the destruction.
2. **Destruction of Resources:** Once confirmed, Terraform will proceed to destroy all resources defined in the configuration, including the application server, database, and load balancer.

The `terraform destroy` command does not:

- **Prompt you to pick which resource to destroy:** It will destroy all resources defined in the configuration unless you specify targets with `-target` flags.
- **Destroy resources based on their order in the code:** The order of resources in the `main.tf` file does not affect their destruction.
- **Destroy the `main.tf` file:** The `terraform destroy` command only affects the infrastructure, not the configuration files.
- **Immediately destroy all the infrastructure:** Terraform will always prompt for confirmation before proceeding with destruction.

### Summary

The correct behavior of `terraform destroy` without any flags is to prompt you to confirm that you want to destroy all the infrastructure. This confirmation step ensures that you intentionally want to remove all the resources managed by Terraform.
