# Module Variable Access in Terraform

## Question

A module can always refer to all variables declared in its parent module.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Explanation

**False**

**Explanation:** A module in Terraform cannot always refer to all variables declared in its parent module. Variables declared in a parent module are not automatically available to child modules. Instead, child modules must explicitly receive input variables from their parent modules. The parent module can pass specific variables to child modules using the `module` block's `input_variable_name = value` syntax.

**Other Options:**

- **True:** This would imply that child modules have access to all parent module variables by default, which is not correct. Variables must be explicitly passed to child modules for them to be accessible.

### Summary

A module **cannot always refer to all variables declared in its parent module**. Child modules only have access to variables that are explicitly passed to them by their parent modules.
