# Examples of Infrastructure as Code

## Question

Which are examples of infrastructure as code? Choose two correct answers.

- [ ] Cloned virtual machine images
- [x] Versioned configuration files
- [ ] Change management database records
- [ ] Docker files

## Explanation

**Versioned configuration files**

**Explanation:** **Versioned configuration files** are a fundamental example of infrastructure as code (IaC). These files (such as Terraform `.tf` files, AWS CloudFormation templates, or Ansible playbooks) define the infrastructure in a declarative or procedural manner. By versioning these files, teams can track changes, roll back configurations, and manage infrastructure in a repeatable and controlled way.

**Docker files**

**Explanation:** Although **Docker files** are used to define how Docker images are built, they are not typically categorized as infrastructure as code. Dockerfiles are important for containerizing applications and defining their runtime environments, but infrastructure as code primarily refers to managing and provisioning infrastructure through code, such as with Terraform or CloudFormation.

**Other Options:**

- **Cloned virtual machine images:** Cloning VM images is a method of duplicating existing infrastructure but is not considered infrastructure as code. IaC focuses on defining and managing infrastructure using code rather than duplicating existing setups.

- **Change management database records:** Change management records are part of the process of managing changes in infrastructure but are not themselves infrastructure as code. IaC involves the definition and management of infrastructure through code rather than tracking changes in a database.

### Summary

**Versioned configuration files** are an example of infrastructure as code, as they involve defining and managing infrastructure using code in a version-controlled and repeatable manner. **Docker files** are related to containerization and do not typically fall under the category of infrastructure as code.
