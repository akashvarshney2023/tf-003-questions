# Updating the State File with External Changes

## Question

What Terraform command always causes a state file to be updated with changes that might have been made outside of Terraform?

- [ ] `terraform plan -refresh-only`
- [ ] `terraform show -json`
- [ ] `terraform apply -lock=false`
- [ ] `terraform plan -target-state`

## Explanation

**`terraform plan -refresh-only`**

**Explanation:** The command **`terraform plan -refresh-only`** is used to update the Terraform state file with the latest information about resources that may have been changed outside of Terraform. This command refreshes the state file by querying the real infrastructure to reflect any changes made outside of Terraform. It does not make any changes to the infrastructure itself but ensures that the state file accurately represents the current state of the resources.

**Other Options:**

- **`terraform show -json`**: This command displays the state or plan in JSON format but does not update the state file or refresh it with external changes.

- **`terraform apply -lock=false`**: This command applies changes to the infrastructure, and the `-lock=false` flag disables state locking during the apply process. It does not specifically refresh the state file with external changes.

- **`terraform plan -target-state`**: This is not a valid Terraform command. The `-target` option can be used to specify particular resources to target, but there is no `-target-state` option.

### Summary

To ensure that the state file is updated with changes that might have been made outside of Terraform, you should use the **`terraform plan -refresh-only`** command. This command refreshes the state file to reflect the current state of resources without making any modifications to the infrastructure.
