Terraform providers are not always installed from the Internet. While Terraform Registry is the primary source for providers, there are several other ways providers can be sourced:

1. **Terraform Registry**:
   - The most common and default method where providers are downloaded from the official Terraform Registry.

2. **Local File System**:
   - Providers can be installed from a local file system. This is useful in scenarios where custom providers are developed in-house or when you want to avoid external dependencies.
   - Example configuration:
     ```hcl
     terraform {
       required_providers {
         custom = {
           source = "./path/to/local/provider"
           version = "1.0.0"
         }
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Private Registry**:
   - Organizations can host private registries to distribute internal providers securely.
   - Example configuration:
     ```hcl
     terraform {
       required_providers {
         mycorp = {
           source = "mycorp/internal-provider"
           version = "1.0.0"
         }
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Other Sources**:
   - Providers can also be installed from other sources using different protocols, such as Git repositories or custom HTTP endpoints, although this is less common.

Therefore, while the Internet is the default and most common source for Terraform providers, there are multiple ways to install providers that do not require an Internet connection.
