# Determining Provider Loading Paths in Terraform

## Question

You want to know from which paths Terraform is loading providers referenced in your Terraform configuration (`*.tf` files). You need to enable additional logging messages to find this out. Which of the following would achieve this?

- [ ] Set verbose for each provider in your Terraform configuration
- [ ] Set the environment variable `TF_LOG_TRACE`
- [ ] Set the environment variable `TF_LOG_PATH`
- [x] Set the environment variable `TF_LOG=TRACE`

## Explanation

**Set the environment variable `TF_LOG=TRACE`**

**Explanation:** To get detailed logging information, including the paths from which Terraform is loading providers, you should set the environment variable **`TF_LOG=TRACE`**. This environment variable enables TRACE-level logging, which provides the most granular level of detail, including debug information about provider loading paths and other internal operations.

**Other Options:**

- **Set verbose for each provider in your Terraform configuration:** Terraform does not support setting verbosity directly for providers within the configuration files. Logging and debugging settings are controlled through environment variables.

- **Set the environment variable `TF_LOG_TRACE`:** This is incorrect. The correct environment variable for TRACE-level logging is `TF_LOG` with the value set to `TRACE`, not `TF_LOG_TRACE`.

- **Set the environment variable `TF_LOG_PATH`:** This environment variable does not exist. To control logging output, `TF_LOG` should be used, and it does not have a `PATH` option.

### Summary

To enable detailed logging and find out from which paths Terraform is loading providers, set the environment variable **`TF_LOG=TRACE`**. This provides extensive debug information about Terraform's internal operations, including provider loading paths.
