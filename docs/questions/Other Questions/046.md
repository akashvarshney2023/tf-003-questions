# Extracting IDs from a List of Objects in Terraform

## Question

You have declared a variable called `var.list`, which is a list of objects that all have an attribute `id`. Which options will produce a list of the IDs? Choose two correct answers.

- [ ] [ var.list [ * ] , id ]
- [x] [ for o in var.list : o.Id ]
- [x] var.list[*].id
- [ ] { for o in var.list : o => o.id }

## Explanation of Answers

### [ var.list [ * ] , id ]

**Explanation:** This syntax is incorrect. The correct syntax for extracting specific attributes from a list of objects in Terraform does not use square brackets `[ ]` in this manner. Instead, Terraform uses `for` expressions or direct attribute access with `[*]` for such operations.

### [ for o in var.list : o.Id ]

**Explanation:** This syntax is almost correct but contains a small mistake in the attribute name. The correct way to use a `for` expression to extract a list of IDs from a list of objects is to use the attribute name exactly as it is declared. If the attribute is `id`, the correct syntax should be `for o in var.list : o.id`. Given that `Id` is incorrect if the actual attribute name is `id`, this option is partially incorrect. However, if it were `o.id`, it would be correct.

### var.list[*].id

**Explanation:** This syntax is correct for extracting the `id` attribute from each object in the list `var.list`. The `[*]` notation is used to access a specific attribute from each item in a list. Terraform will iterate over `var.list` and collect all `id` values into a new list.

### { for o in var.list : o => o.id }

**Explanation:** This syntax is used to create a map, not a list. The `for` expression in this format `{ for o in var.list : o => o.id }` creates a map where each key is `o` and the value is `o.id`. This is not what you want if you are looking to extract a list of IDs; you need a list, not a map.
