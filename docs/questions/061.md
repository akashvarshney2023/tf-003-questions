# Using Multiple Configurations of the Same Terraform Provider

## Question

When using multiple configurations of the same Terraform provider, what meta-argument must you include in any non-default provider configurations?

- [x] Alias
- [ ] Id
- [ ] Depends_on
- [ ] Name

## Explanation

**Alias**

**Explanation:** When you use multiple configurations of the same Terraform provider, you must use the `alias` meta-argument to differentiate between these configurations. The `alias` allows you to assign unique names to different provider configurations, enabling you to specify which configuration should be used for each resource or data source.

Hereâ€™s an example of using `alias` with multiple configurations of the same provider:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us_east"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us_west"
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "east" {
  provider = aws.us_east
  # Other resource configurations
}

resource "aws_instance" "west" {
  provider = aws.us_west
  # Other resource configurations
}
```

**Id**

**Explanation:** The `id` meta-argument is not used to differentiate provider configurations. It is typically used to specify or reference the unique identifier of a resource but is not relevant for configuring multiple provider instances.

**Depends_on**

**Explanation:** The `depends_on` meta-argument is used to specify dependencies between resources, ensuring that certain resources are created before others. It does not apply to provider configurations.

**Name**

**Explanation:** The `name` meta-argument is not used for defining multiple provider configurations. The `alias` is the correct argument used to manage multiple instances of the same provider.

### Summary

When using multiple configurations of the same Terraform provider, the `alias` meta-argument must be included in any non-default provider configurations. This allows Terraform to distinguish between different provider instances and apply configurations correctly.
