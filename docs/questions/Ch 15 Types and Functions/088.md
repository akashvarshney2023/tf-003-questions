# Choosing a Terraform Variable Type for Structured Data

## Question

You want to define a single input variable to store information about servers, mainly `server-name` of type string and `memory-size` of type number. Which variable type should you choose?

- [ ] list
- [ ] map
- [x] object
- [ ] set

## Explanation

**object**

**Explanation:** The **`object`** variable type is the best choice for defining a single input variable that contains multiple attributes of different types. In this case, you want to store both `server-name` (a string) and `memory-size` (a number). The `object` type allows you to define a structured variable with named attributes, making it ideal for representing complex data structures.

**Other Options:**

- **list:** A `list` is an ordered collection of values of the same type. It is not suitable for storing named attributes with different types.

- **map:** A `map` is a collection of key/value pairs where all values must be of the same type. It does not support structured data with multiple types.

- **set:** A `set` is an unordered collection of unique values, which does not support storing multiple attributes with different types.

### Summary

To define a single input variable that stores structured information about servers, including `server-name` of type string and `memory-size` of type number, you should use the **`object`** variable type. This allows for a well-defined structure with named attributes and varying data types.
