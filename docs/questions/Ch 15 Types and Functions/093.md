# Complex Types in Terraform

## Question

What are complex types in Terraform?

- [x] A type that groups multiple values into a single value.
- [ ] A variation of a string type.
- [ ] A variance of a data source.
- [ ] A type that derives its value from RegEx logic.

## Explanation

**A type that groups multiple values into a single value.**

**Explanation:** In Terraform, **complex types** are types that allow you to group multiple values into a single, cohesive unit. This includes types like `object`, `tuple`, and `map`. These complex types enable the creation of structured and organized data representations, allowing for more flexible and manageable Terraform configurations.

**Other Options:**

- **A variation of a string type:** Complex types are not variations of the string type. They are distinct types designed to handle more structured and varied data.

- **A variance of a data source:** Complex types are not related to data sources but rather to how data is structured within variables.

- **A type that derives its value from RegEx logic:** Complex types are not derived from regular expressions. They are used to structure data in a more organized way.

### Summary

In Terraform, **complex types** refer to types that group multiple values into a single value, such as `object`, `tuple`, and `map`. These types help in managing structured data within Terraform configurations.
