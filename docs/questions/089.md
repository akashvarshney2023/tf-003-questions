# Complex Variable Types in Terraform

## Question

What are the similar kinds of complex types in Terraform? (Select three)

- [x] list
- [x] map
- [x] tuple
- [ ] set

## Explanation

**list**

**Explanation:** The **`list`** type is a complex type in Terraform used to define an ordered collection of values. Each element in a list can be accessed by its index, and lists can contain values of the same or different types.

**map**

**Explanation:** The **`map`** type is a complex type that allows for the definition of key/value pairs, where each key is unique and associated with a value. All values in a map must be of the same type.

**tuple**

**Explanation:** The **`tuple`** type is a complex type that defines an ordered collection of elements where each element can be of a different type. It is useful for defining a fixed-size collection with heterogeneous types.

**set**

**Explanation:** The **`set`** type is a complex type, but it is not selected here. Sets are unordered collections of unique values. While it is indeed a complex type, it is not as closely related to `list`, `map`, and `tuple` in terms of how they are used to define structured data with multiple elements or attributes.

### Summary

The complex types in Terraform that are similar in function are **`list`**, **`map`**, and **`tuple`**. These types provide various ways to organize and structure data with different attributes and values.
