# Best Practices for Making Changes in Infrastructure as Code

## Question
As a member of an operations team that uses Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices, you are tasked with making a change to an infrastructure stack running in a public cloud.
Which pattern would follow IaC best practices for making a change?

- [ ] Make the change via the public cloud API endpoint
- [ ] Clone the repository containing your infrastructure code and then run the code
- [ ] Use the public cloud console to make the change after a database record has been approved
- [ ] Make the change programmatically via the public cloud CLI
- [ ] Submit a pull request and wait for an approved merge of the proposed changes

## Answer

### **Submit a pull request and wait for an approved merge of the proposed changes**

**Explanation**:
Following Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices means treating infrastructure definitions as code and managing them in a version-controlled repository. This approach ensures changes are tracked, reviewed, and auditable. Submitting a pull request and waiting for an approved merge is the best practice because it involves:

1. **Version Control**: All changes are tracked in a version control system (e.g., Git).
2. **Review Process**: Changes can be reviewed by other team members to catch potential issues and ensure compliance with standards.
3. **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipelines can be used to test the proposed changes before they are merged and applied.
4. **Auditability**: A record of who made changes and when is maintained, providing transparency and accountability.

- [ ] Clone the repository containing your infrastructure code and then run the code
- [ ] Use the public cloud console to make the change after a database record has been approved
- [ ] Make the change programmatically via the public cloud CLI
- [x] Submit a pull request and wait for an approved merge of the proposed changes

## Summary

The best pattern for making a change to an infrastructure stack following IaC best practices is to submit a pull request and wait for an approved merge of the proposed changes. This approach ensures that changes are reviewed, tested, and tracked in a version-controlled manner, aligning with IaC principles.
