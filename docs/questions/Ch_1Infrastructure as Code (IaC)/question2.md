### Answer Explanation

Terraform offers several significant advantages as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool:

- **Terraform can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms:** Terraform supports multiple cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), allowing you to manage infrastructure across different platforms with a unified tool.

- **Terraform’s state allows you to track resource changes throughout your deployments:** The state file in Terraform tracks the current state of your resources, enabling you to see changes, roll back if necessary, and ensure your infrastructure matches the configuration.

- **You can commit your configurations to version control to safely collaborate on infrastructure:** Storing Terraform configurations in a version control system (VCS) allows teams to collaborate, review changes, and maintain a history of modifications, ensuring better management and traceability of infrastructure changes.

The correct answer is **All of the above**, as Terraform provides all these advantages.
