# Valid Terraform Structural Types

## Question

Which of the following are valid Terraform structural types? (Choose 2 answers)

- [ ] optional
- [x] object
- [ ] pair
- [x] tuple

## Explanation

**object**

**Explanation:** The **`object`** type in Terraform is a structural type used to define a complex variable with multiple named attributes, where each attribute can have a different type. It allows you to group related variables together into a single cohesive structure.

**tuple**

**Explanation:** The **`tuple`** type is another valid structural type in Terraform. It represents an ordered collection of elements, where each element can be of a different type. Tuples are useful for defining fixed-size collections with heterogeneous types.

**Other Options:**

- **optional:** This is not a structural type but rather a concept related to specifying whether an attribute in an `object` is required or optional.

- **pair:** There is no `pair` type in Terraform. The closest concept is the `map`, which consists of key/value pairs, but `pair` itself is not a recognized type.

### Summary

The valid Terraform structural types are **`object`** and **`tuple`**. These types enable the creation of complex, structured variables with varying attributes and data types.
