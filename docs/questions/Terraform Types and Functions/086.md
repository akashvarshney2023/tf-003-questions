## Question

- [ ] max()
- [ ] regex()
- [ ] alltrue()
- [ ] delete()

## Explanation

**max()**

**Explanation:** The **`max()`** function is a built-in function in Terraform used to return the maximum value from a list of numbers. It is useful for determining the highest value within a given list.

**regex()**

**Explanation:** The **`regex()`** function is used to match a regular expression pattern against a string and return a list of matches. It helps in performing complex string manipulations and validations.

**alltrue()**

**Explanation:** The **`alltrue()`** function is used to check if all elements in a list are `true`. It returns `true` if every element in the list evaluates to `true`, and `false` otherwise.

**delete()**

**Explanation:** The **`delete()`** function is not a built-in Terraform function. Instead, Terraform uses the **`remove()`** function to remove elements from a map or list, but there is no `delete()` function.

**Other Option:**

- **delete():** This function does not exist in Terraform. The `remove()` function is used for similar purposes.

### Summary

Some of the built-in functions provided by Terraform are **`max()`**, **`regex()`**, and **`alltrue()`**. These functions are used for various operations such as finding maximum values, pattern matching, and evaluating boolean conditions in lists.
