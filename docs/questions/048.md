# State Locking Support in Terraform Backends

## Question

_______ backends support state locking.

- [ ] All
- [ ] No
- [x] Some
- [ ] Only local

## Explanation

**Some**

**Explanation:** In Terraform, state locking is a mechanism to prevent simultaneous operations that could corrupt the state file. This feature is not universally available across all backends. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **State Locking in Certain Backends**:
   - **Remote Backends**: Many remote backends support state locking. For instance:
     - **AWS S3 with DynamoDB**: Using AWS S3 for state storage combined with DynamoDB for state locking.
     - **Azure Blob Storage with Azure Cosmos DB**: Using Azure Blob Storage for state files and Azure Cosmos DB for locking.
     - **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**: GCS with locking capabilities through GCS buckets or other integrated solutions.
   - **Terraform Cloud**: Terraform Cloud provides built-in state locking as part of its managed service.

2. **Backends Without State Locking**:
   - **Local Backend**: The local backend, which stores the state file on the local filesystem, does not support state locking. This is because the state file is local to the user's machine, making it difficult to coordinate locking in a multi-user or distributed environment.
   - **Other Backends**: Some other specialized or custom backends might not support state locking.

3. **State Locking is Not Universally Supported**:
   - **No State Locking**: Some backends or configurations do not implement state locking due to their design or intended use cases.

### Summary

State locking is a critical feature for collaborative and production environments to avoid conflicts and corruption of the state file. While many remote backends support state locking, the local backend and some other backends do not.
