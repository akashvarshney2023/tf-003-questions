# Core Terraform Workflow for an Individual Practitioner

## **How are the Core Terraform Workflow steps played out by an Individual Practitioner?**

- [ ] Plan, Write, Apply
- [x] Write, Plan, Apply
- [ ] Apply, Write, Plan
- [ ] Apply, Plan, Write

### Answer Explanation

- **Write, Plan, Apply:** This is the correct sequence of the core Terraform workflow. An individual practitioner typically follows these steps:
  - **Write:** Define the infrastructure as code by writing the Terraform configuration files.
  - **Plan:** Generate an execution plan by running `terraform plan` to preview the changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure.
  - **Apply:** Apply the changes defined in the configuration files to the infrastructure by running `terraform apply`.

- **Plan, Write, Apply** and other sequences are incorrect because they do not follow the logical order of defining, planning, and applying changes.

### Summary

The correct order of the core Terraform workflow steps for an individual practitioner is **Write, Plan, Apply**.
