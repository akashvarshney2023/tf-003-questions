# Terraform Configuration File for Defining Resources

## **Which file is typically used to define resources in a Terraform configuration?**

- [x] main.tf
- [ ] terraform.tfvars
- [ ] variables.tf
- [ ] outputs.tf

### Answer Explanation

- **main.tf:** This is the correct file typically used to define resources in a Terraform configuration. The `main.tf` file is commonly where the primary resources, providers, and data sources are declared. It serves as the main entry point for the configuration.

- **terraform.tfvars:** This file is used to define variables and their values but not to define resources directly.

- **variables.tf:** This file is used to declare input variables but not to define resources.

- **outputs.tf:** This file is used to define output values, which are the values that are displayed after `terraform apply` is run, but not for defining resources.

### Summary

The **main.tf** file is typically used to define resources in a Terraform configuration.
