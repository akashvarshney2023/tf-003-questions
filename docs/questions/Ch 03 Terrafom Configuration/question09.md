# Understanding Terraform Language

## **Which of the statements accurately describes the Terraform language?** (Select two)

- [ ] **Terraform is declarative Infrastructure as Code provisioning language based on Hashicorp Configuration Language, or optionally YAML.**
- [x] **Terraform is declarative Infrastructure as Code provisioning language based on Hashicorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON.**
- [x] **Code in the Terraform language is stored in plain text files with the .tf file extension, or optionally with the .tf.json file extension.**
- [ ] **Code in the Terraform language is stored in plain text files with the .tf file extension, or optionally with the .tf.yml file extension.**

### Answer Explanation

- **Terraform is declarative Infrastructure as Code provisioning language based on Hashicorp Configuration Language, or optionally YAML:** This option is incorrect. Terraform supports JSON as an alternative syntax but does not natively support YAML.

- **Terraform is declarative Infrastructure as Code provisioning language based on Hashicorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON:** This option is correct. Terraform uses Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL) by default and also supports JSON as an alternative format.

- **Code in the Terraform language is stored in plain text files with the .tf file extension, or optionally with the .tf.json file extension:** This option is correct. Terraform configuration files use the `.tf` extension for HCL and `.tf.json` for JSON.

- **Code in the Terraform language is stored in plain text files with the .tf file extension, or optionally with the .tf.yml file extension:** This option is incorrect. Terraform does not support YAML as a configuration format.

### Summary

Terraform is a **declarative Infrastructure as Code (IaC) language** that primarily uses **Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL)** and supports **JSON** as an alternative syntax. Configuration files are typically stored with the `.tf` or `.tf.json` file extensions.
