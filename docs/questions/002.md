## You are creating a Terraform configuration which needs to make use of multiple providers, one for AWS and one for Azure. What is the right way to do that?

To create a Terraform configuration that uses multiple providers, such as AWS and Azure, you need to define separate provider blocks for each. Hereâ€™s how you can define and use these providers in your Terraform configuration:

### Defining Multiple Providers

```hcl
# Define the AWS provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Define the Azure provider
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

### test Resource Usage

```hcl
# Use the AWS provider to create an S3 bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "test" {
  bucket = "my-test-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}

# Use the Azure provider to create a resource group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "test" {
  name     = "test-resources"
  location = "West US"
}
```

### Explanation
- **AWS Provider Block**: Configures the AWS provider with a specified region.
- **Azure Provider Block**: Configures the Azure provider. The `features {}` block is required but can be left empty as shown.
- **Resource Definitions**: Resources for both AWS and Azure are defined, each using their respective provider.

This configuration allows you to manage resources in both AWS and Azure within the same Terraform configuration. You can extend this by adding more resources and configurations as needed.
