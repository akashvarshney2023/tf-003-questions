## A developer accidentally launched a VM (virtual machine) outside of the Terraform workflow and ended up with two servers with the same name. They don't know which VM Terraform manages but do have a list of all active VM IDs.Which of the following methods could you use to discover which instance Terraform manages?

- [x] Run terraform state list to find the names of all VMs, then run terraform state show for each of them to find which VM ID Terraform manages
- [ ] Update the code to include outputs for the ID of all VMs, then run terraform plan to view the outputs
- [ ] Run terraform taint/code on all the VMs to recreate them
- [ ] Use terraform refresh/code to find out which IDs are already part of state

To discover which instance Terraform manages, you should use the `terraform state list` and `terraform state show` commands. This approach helps you identify the specific VM instance managed by Terraform.

Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Run `terraform state list`**:
   - This command lists all the resources currently tracked in your Terraform state file. It will give you the names of all VMs managed by Terraform.

  ```hcl
   terraform state list
   ```

2. **Run `terraform state show` for each VM**:
   - After identifying the VM resource names from the previous step, use the `terraform state show` command to get detailed information about each VM, including the VM ID.

  ```hcl
   terraform state show <resource_name>
   ```

   For example:

  ```hcl
   terraform state show aws_instance.example
   ```

   This command will show details of the `aws_instance.example` resource, including the VM ID managed by Terraform.

By comparing the VM IDs obtained from `terraform state show` with your list of all active VM IDs, you can identify which VM is managed by Terraform.

### Why Not the Other Methods?

- **Update the code to include outputs for the ID of all VMs, then run `terraform plan` to view the outputs**:
  - This method is indirect and may not immediately resolve the issue, as it requires changes to the code and an additional plan step.

- **Run `terraform taint` on all the VMs to recreate them**:
  - This is a destructive approach, as it marks resources for recreation, which may lead to unnecessary downtime and changes to your infrastructure.

- **Use `terraform refresh` to find out which IDs are already part of state**:
  - While `terraform refresh` updates the state file with the current real-world infrastructure, it doesn't directly provide the IDs of the VMs. You would still need to use `terraform state show` to get detailed information.

Therefore, the most effective and non-destructive method is to use `terraform state list` followed by `terraform state show` to identify the VM managed by Terraform.
