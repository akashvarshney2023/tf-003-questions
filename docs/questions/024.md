The benefits of using Sentinel with Terraform Cloud/Terraform Enterprise include the following:

- [x] **You can enforce a list of approved AWS AMIs**
  - Sentinel allows you to create policies that enforce specific criteria, such as using only approved AWS AMIs.

- [x] **Policy-as-code can enforce security best practices**
  - Sentinel's policy-as-code approach enables you to enforce security best practices across your infrastructure as code (IaC) deployments.

- [ ] **You can check out and check in cloud access keys**
  - This is not a feature of Sentinel. Managing cloud access keys typically involves using cloud provider services and tools, not Sentinel.

- [x] **You can restrict specific resource configurations, such as disallowing the use of CIDR=0.0.0.0/0.**
  - Sentinel allows you to enforce policies that restrict certain configurations, such as disallowing overly permissive CIDR blocks.

- [ ] **Sentinel Policies can be written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)**
  - Sentinel policies are written in the Sentinel policy language, not in HCL.

So, the correct answers are:

- [x] You can enforce a list of approved AWS AMIs
- [x] Policy-as-code can enforce security best practices
- [x] You can restrict specific resource configurations, such as disallowing the use of CIDR=0.0.0.0/0.

## Question

What are some benefits of using Sentinel with Terraform Cloud/Terraform Enterprise? Choose three correct answers.

- [x] You can enforce a list of approved AWS AMIs
- [x] Policy-as-code can enforce security best practices
- [ ] You can check out and check in cloud access keys
- [x] You can restrict specific resource configurations, such as disallowing the use of CIDR=0.0.0.0/0.
- [ ] Sentinel Policies can be written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)

## Explanation

Sentinel with Terraform Cloud/Terraform Enterprise offers several benefits:

- **Enforcing a list of approved AWS AMIs**: Sentinel allows you to create policies that enforce specific criteria, such as using only approved AWS AMIs.

- **Policy-as-code to enforce security best practices**: Sentinel's policy-as-code approach enables you to enforce security best practices across your infrastructure as code (IaC) deployments.

- **Restricting specific resource configurations**: Sentinel allows you to enforce policies that restrict certain configurations, such as disallowing overly permissive CIDR blocks.

Managing cloud access keys and writing policies in HCL are not features of Sentinel.
