# Version Constraint Operator

## **Question**

**What does the specified constraint `version = "~> 1.0.4"` mean in the `required_providers` block?**

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    mycloud = {
      source  = "mycorp/mycloud"
      version = "~> 1.0.4"
    }
  }
}
```

- [ ] >= 1.0.4 and <= 1.1.0
- [x] >= 1.0.4 and < 1.1.0
- [ ] > 1.0.4 and < 2.0.0
- [ ] >= 1.0.5 and < 1.1.0

## Explanation

### `~> 1.0.4` Constraint

The `~> 1.0.4` version constraint is a "pessimistic constraint" that allows for patch-level updates but not minor or major updates that could introduce breaking changes.

**Explanation:**

- The constraint `~> 1.0.4` means the version must be at least `1.0.4` but less than `1.1.0`.
- This allows for updates such as `1.0.5`, `1.0.6`, etc., but does not allow `1.1.0` or any version higher than `1.1.0`.

### Other Options

#### `>= 1.0.4 and <= 1.1.0`

This is incorrect because the constraint allows versions up to but not including `1.1.0`.

#### `> 1.0.4 and < 2.0.0`

This is incorrect because the constraint is limited to patch updates and does not allow for major version updates that could include breaking changes.

#### `>= 1.0.5 and < 1.1.0`

This is incorrect because the constraint includes `1.0.4` and allows for updates from `1.0.4` onwards.

## Summary

The specified constraint `version = "~> 1.0.4"` in the `required_providers` block means the version must be `>= 1.0.4` and `< 1.1.0`. This ensures that only patch updates are allowed, providing stability and avoiding breaking changes from minor or major updates.
