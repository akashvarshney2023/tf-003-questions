# Creating a New Development Workspace Quickly

**As a prestigious Sr. Cloud Engineer, your colleague comes up to you and asks for a new Development workspace. What’s the fastest way to accomplish this?**

- [x] Through CLI `terraform workspace new dev`
- [ ] Head to the Terraform Enterprise console and create a new workspace there.
- [ ] Specify in the configuration block the new workspace to be created.
- [ ] Have them submit a Jira ticket and tell them you’ll get around to it in the next Sprint.

### Explanation

The fastest way to create a new Development workspace is by using the **CLI command `terraform workspace new dev`**. This command creates a new workspace named `dev` and switches to it immediately.

**Options Explained:**

- **Through CLI `terraform workspace new dev`**: This is the quickest method as it creates and switches to the new workspace directly from the command line.
- **Head to the Terraform Enterprise console and create a new workspace there**: While this method works, it is slower compared to using the CLI command and requires manual navigation through the console.
- **Specify in the configuration block the new workspace to be created**: Workspaces cannot be defined directly in the configuration block; they must be created via the CLI or UI.
- **Have them submit a Jira ticket and tell them you’ll get around to it in the next Sprint**: This is not a fast method and does not address the immediate need for creating a workspace.

## Summary

The fastest way to create a new Development workspace is by using the **CLI command `terraform workspace new dev`**, which provides a quick and efficient solution to the request.
