# Terraform Working Directory Initialization

## Question

You must initialize your working directory before running `terraform validate`.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

## Explanation

**True**

**Explanation:** Before running `terraform validate`, you must initialize your working directory with **`terraform init`**. The `terraform init` command sets up the working directory by downloading the necessary provider plugins and initializing the backend, which is required for Terraform to properly understand and validate the configuration files. Without initialization, Terraform may not be able to validate configurations correctly due to missing dependencies or an uninitialized backend.

**Other Option:**

- **False:** This is incorrect because `terraform validate` requires the working directory to be initialized first. The `terraform init` command is a prerequisite for running `terraform validate` to ensure all dependencies and configurations are properly set up.

### Summary

You must **initialize your working directory before running `terraform validate`** by using the `terraform init` command. This ensures that all necessary plugins and configurations are properly set up.
