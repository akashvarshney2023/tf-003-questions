### You're building a CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery) pipeline and need to inject sensitive variables into your Terraform run. How can you do this safely?

- Copy the sensitive variables into your Terraform code
- Store the sensitive variables in a secure_varS.tf file
- Store the sensitive variables as plain text in a source code repository
- Pass variables to Terraform with a -var flag

To safely inject sensitive variables into your Terraform run in a CI/CD pipeline, you should use a method that ensures those variables are kept secure and are not exposed inappropriately. Here are the safe practices you should consider:

1. **Use Environment Variables or CI/CD Secrets Management**:
   - Most CI/CD systems have mechanisms for securely managing and injecting sensitive information into build processes. Use these features to securely pass sensitive variables to Terraform without exposing them in your code or repository.

2. **Use the `-var` Flag with Caution**:
   - You can use the `-var` flag to pass variables directly on the command line, but be cautious because these variables can be exposed in CI/CD logs or process listings.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     terraform apply -var="sensitive_variable=${SENSITIVE_VAR}"
     ```

3. **Store Sensitive Variables Securely**:
   - Use Terraform's support for sensitive variables to handle sensitive information. Mark variables as sensitive in your Terraform code to prevent them from being logged or displayed in Terraform plan outputs.

### Why Not the Other Options?

- **Copy the sensitive variables into your Terraform code**:
  - This is insecure because it exposes sensitive information in your source code, which may be checked into version control and accessed by unauthorized users.

- **Store the sensitive variables in a `secure_vars.tf` file**:
  - Storing sensitive information in a file, even if named `secure_vars.tf`, is not secure unless this file is protected appropriately (e.g., by using `.gitignore` to prevent it from being checked into version control). Additionally, it can still be exposed to anyone with access to the file system.

- **Store the sensitive variables as plain text in a source code repository**:
  - This is highly insecure as it makes sensitive information visible to anyone with access to the repository.

### Best Practices for Handling Sensitive Variables

1. **Use Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise**:
   - These platforms provide secure ways to manage sensitive variables, including encryption and access control.

2. **Use Secrets Management Tools**:
   - Integrate with secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely retrieve and manage sensitive information.

3. **Mark Sensitive Variables in Terraform**:
   - Define sensitive variables in Terraform to prevent accidental exposure in logs or outputs:
     ```hcl
     variable "api_key" {
       description = "API key for accessing services"
       type        = string
       sensitive   = true
     }
     ```

By following these practices, you can safely manage and inject sensitive variables into your Terraform runs.
