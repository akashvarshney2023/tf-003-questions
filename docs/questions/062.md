# Terraform State File and Variable Names

## Question

Terraform variable names are saved in the state file.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Explanation

**False**

**Explanation:** Terraform state files do not store variable names. Instead, the state file contains information about the resources that Terraform manages, including their attributes and metadata, but it does not retain the variable names used in the Terraform configurations.

The state file includes:

- Resource IDs and metadata
- Resource attributes and their values
- Configuration for resources as applied

It does not include:

- Variable names or their values (these are not saved in the state file)
- Configuration values that are only used for planning and applying changes

The purpose of the state file is to track the current state of resources so that Terraform can manage updates and changes accurately. Variables used in Terraform configurations are defined in `.tf` files and are passed to Terraform as part of the configuration or through environment variables, but they are not included in the state file.

### Summary

The statement "Terraform variable names are saved in the state file" is false. Terraform state files store information about managed resources and their attributes, not the variable names used in configurations.
