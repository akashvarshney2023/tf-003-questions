# Terraform as an Infrastructure as Code Tool

## Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that is? (Select two)

- [ ] Imperative
- [x] Declarative
- [x] Cloud-agnostic
- [ ] Cloud-native

### Answer Explanation

- **Declarative:** Terraform uses a declarative approach to define infrastructure. This means you describe the desired state of your infrastructure, and Terraform handles the creation and management of the resources to achieve that state.

- **Cloud-agnostic:** Terraform is cloud-agnostic, meaning it supports multiple cloud providers and can manage resources across different platforms such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and others. This allows for a unified approach to infrastructure management regardless of the underlying cloud provider.

- **Imperative:** Terraform is not imperative. In an imperative approach, you specify the exact steps to achieve a desired state. Terraform uses a declarative approach instead.

- **Cloud-native:** While Terraform can manage cloud resources, it is not considered cloud-native as it is designed to work across multiple cloud platforms rather than being specifically tailored to a single cloud provider.

### Summary

Terraform is best described as a "declarative" and "cloud-agnostic" tool, as it allows users to define the desired state of infrastructure in a high-level way and can manage resources across various cloud providers.
