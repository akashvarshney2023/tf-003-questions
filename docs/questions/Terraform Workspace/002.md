# Terraform Feature for Managing Small Differences Between Environments

**What Terraform feature is most applicable for managing small differences between different environments, for example development and production?**

- [x] Workspaces
- [ ] States
- [ ] Repositories
- [ ] Versions

### Explanation

In Terraform, **Workspaces** are used to manage different environments or stages (such as development, staging, and production) within the same configuration. Workspaces allow you to isolate state files and manage configurations that may vary slightly between environments. By using workspaces, you can handle small differences between environments without needing to duplicate your entire configuration.

**States** are used to track the current state of your resources, but they do not inherently manage differences between environments.

**Repositories** refer to version control systems where Terraform code can be stored, but they are not specifically designed to manage environmental differences.

**Versions** refer to versioning of modules or providers and do not manage environmental differences directly.

## Summary

The correct answer is **Workspaces**: They are specifically designed to handle small differences between environments by managing isolated state files for each workspace.
