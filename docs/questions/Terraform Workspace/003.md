# Where Are Terraform Workspace Local State Files Stored?

**Where are Terraform Workspace local state files stored?**

- [ ] a directory called terraform.tfstate.d
- [ ] a file called terraform.tfstate
- [ ] a temp directory called .tfstate*
- [ ] a directory called terraform.workspaces.tfstate

### Explanation

In Terraform, local state files for workspaces are stored in a directory called `terraform.tfstate.d`. This directory contains separate state files for each workspace. The state files are named according to the workspace they belong to, and the `terraform.tfstate.d` directory helps manage these files efficiently.

**Options Explained:**

- **a directory called terraform.tfstate.d**: This is the correct location where Terraform stores local state files for each workspace.
- **a file called terraform.tfstate**: This file is used for the default workspace and not specifically for all workspaces.
- **a temp directory called .tfstate***: This is not a standard directory used by Terraform for storing state files.
- **a directory called terraform.workspaces.tfstate**: This is not a valid directory for Terraform state files.

## Summary

The correct answer is **a directory called terraform.tfstate.d**: This directory is used by Terraform to store local state files for different workspaces.
