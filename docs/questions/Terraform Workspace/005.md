- [ ] terraform workspace –new –new-hire
- [x] terraform workspace new new-hire
- [ ] terraform workspace init new-hire
- [ ] terraform workspace new-hire

### Explanation

To create a new Terraform workspace named `new-hire`, the correct command is **`terraform workspace new new-hire`**. This command will create a new workspace with the specified name.

**Options Explained:**

- **terraform workspace –new –new-hire**: This command is incorrect because it uses incorrect syntax for creating a new workspace.
- **terraform workspace new new-hire**: This is the correct command for creating a new workspace named `new-hire`.
- **terraform workspace init new-hire**: This command is incorrect because `terraform workspace init` is not a valid command; `init` is used to initialize a working directory.
- **terraform workspace new-hire**: This command is incorrect because it omits the `new` keyword needed to create a new workspace.

## Summary

The correct command to create a new workspace named `new-hire` is **terraform workspace new new-hire**. This command creates and switches to the new workspace.
