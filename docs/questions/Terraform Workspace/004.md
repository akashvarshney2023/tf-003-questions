# Reusing Terraform Configuration with Different State Files

**You would like to reuse the same Terraform configuration for your development and production environments with a different state file for each. Which command would you use?**

- [ ] terraform import
- [x] terraform workspace
- [ ] terraform state
- [ ] terraform init

### Explanation

To reuse the same Terraform configuration for different environments (e.g., development and production) while maintaining separate state files for each environment, you would use the **terraform workspace** command. Workspaces allow you to manage multiple environments using the same configuration by isolating the state files.

**Options Explained:**

- **terraform import**: This command is used to import existing resources into Terraform's state file, not for managing multiple environments.
- **terraform workspace**: This command is used to create, select, and manage workspaces, which helps in maintaining different state files for different environments.
- **terraform state**: This command is used for state file management tasks, such as listing resources or modifying state, but it does not manage multiple environments.
- **terraform init**: This command initializes a Terraform working directory, but it does not handle multiple state files for different environments.

## Summary

The correct answer is **terraform workspace**: This command allows you to manage different state files for separate environments, such as development and production, using the same Terraform configuration.
