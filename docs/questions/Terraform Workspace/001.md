# TState Management in Terraform Workspaces

**Each Terraform CLI Workspace uses its own state file to manage the infrastructure associated with that particular workspace.**

- [x] True
- [ ] False

### Explanation

In Terraform, each workspace maintains its own separate state file. This state file is used to track the resources managed by Terraform within that workspace. When you switch between workspaces, Terraform will use the state file associated with the currently selected workspace, ensuring that the infrastructure changes are isolated to that specific workspace.

## Summary

The statement is **True**: Each Terraform CLI workspace uses its own state file to manage the infrastructure associated with that particular workspace. This separation helps in managing different environments or stages (such as development, staging, and production) without interfering with each other.
