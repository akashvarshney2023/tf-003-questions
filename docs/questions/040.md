# Question and Answer: When Changes from `terraform apply` Take Effect

## Question
When do changes invoked by `terraform apply` take effect?

- [ ] After Terraform has updated the state file
- [ ] Once the resource provider has fulfilled the request
- [ ] Immediately
- [ ] None of the above are correct

## Answer

### **Once the resource provider has fulfilled the request**

**Explanation**:
When you run `terraform apply`, Terraform makes changes to your infrastructure according to the configuration. However, the actual changes to the resources are only considered effective once the resource provider has fulfilled the request. This means that Terraform sends the requests to the provider, and the provider performs the necessary actions to create, update, or delete the resources.

Here's a breakdown of the options:

- **After Terraform has updated the state file**:
  The state file is updated after the changes have been successfully applied to the infrastructure. The state file reflects the current state of the infrastructure but does not affect when the changes are applied.

- **Once the resource provider has fulfilled the request**:
  This is correct. The changes take effect once the resource provider completes the requested actions (e.g., creating or updating resources). Terraform waits for the provider to confirm that the actions have been successfully executed before finalizing the changes.

- **Immediately**:
  Changes do not take effect immediately. There is a process where Terraform applies the changes and waits for the provider to fulfill the request.

- **None of the above are correct**:
  This is incorrect because the correct timing for changes to take effect is when the resource provider has fulfilled the request.

Therefore, changes invoked by `terraform apply` take effect once the resource provider has fulfilled the request.

## Summary

Changes invoked by `terraform apply` take effect once the resource provider has fulfilled the request. Terraform waits for the provider to complete the necessary actions before considering the changes as applied.
