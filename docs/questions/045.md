# Understanding How Terraform Manages Dependencies Between Resources

## Question

How does Terraform manage most dependencies between resources?

- [x] Terraform will automatically manage most resource dependencies
- [ ] Using the `depends_on` parameter
- [ ] By defining dependencies as modules and including them in a particular order
- [ ] The order that resources appear in Terraform configuration indicates dependencies

## Explanation of Answers

### Terraform will automatically manage most resource dependencies

**Explanation:** Terraform is designed to automatically manage dependencies between resources based on their references within the configuration. When one resource depends on the output of another, Terraform understands this relationship and ensures that resources are created, updated, or destroyed in the correct order. This automatic dependency management is one of Terraform's core features and helps avoid issues related to the order of operations.

### Using the `depends_on` parameter

**Explanation:** The `depends_on` parameter is used to explicitly specify dependencies between resources when they are not automatically inferred by Terraform. This parameter is useful for defining dependencies that are not based on resource outputs but rather on external factors or specific requirements. However, Terraform generally manages most dependencies automatically, so `depends_on` is not the primary method for handling dependencies in most cases.

### By defining dependencies as modules and including them in a particular order

**Explanation:** While organizing Terraform configurations into modules can help manage complexity and reuse code, dependencies between resources within a module are still handled automatically by Terraform. The order of module inclusion does not directly influence how Terraform mana
