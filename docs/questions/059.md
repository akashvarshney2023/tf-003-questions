# Speculative Plan Runs in Terraform Cloud

## Question

In a Terraform Cloud workspace linked to a version control repository, speculative plan runs start automatically commit changes to version control.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Explanation

**False**

**Explanation:** In Terraform Cloud, speculative plan runs are designed to run automatically when changes are detected in the version control repository linked to a workspace. However, speculative plan runs do not automatically commit changes to version control. Instead, they provide a preview of the changes that would be applied if the code were committed. 

Hereâ€™s how speculative plan runs work:

1. **Speculative Plan Runs**: These runs are triggered by changes to a branch in the version control system (VCS) that is linked to a Terraform Cloud workspace. They are used to preview the impact of changes before they are merged into the main branch.

2. **Commit Changes**: Changes to the version control repository must be committed manually by the user. Speculative plans provide a preview of what would happen if these changes were applied, but they do not affect the VCS repository.

3. **Manual Workflow**: After reviewing the speculative plan and ensuring the changes are correct, users can then manually commit and push the changes to the repository. Only after the changes are merged into the main branch does Terraform Cloud perform the actual apply operation based on the committed code.

### Summary

The statement "In a Terraform Cloud workspace linked to a version control repository, speculative plan runs start automatically commit changes to version control" is false. Speculative plan runs provide previews of potential changes but do not automatically commit changes to the version control system.
