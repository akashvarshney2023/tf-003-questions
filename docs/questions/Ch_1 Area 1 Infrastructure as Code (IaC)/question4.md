# Identifying Non-Benefits of Using IaC Tools

## Which is NOT a benefit of using an IaC tool like Terraform?

- [ ] You can commit your configurations to version control to safely collaborate on infrastructure
- [ ] You can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms
- [ ] Infrastructure code is easy to maintain and understand without any Cloud knowledge
- [ ] The human-readable configuration language helps you write infrastructure code quickly

### Answer Explanation

- **You can commit your configurations to version control to safely collaborate on infrastructure:** This is indeed a benefit of using IaC tools like Terraform. Version control systems help in tracking changes and collaborating effectively.

- **You can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms:** Terraform's ability to manage infrastructure across various cloud providers is a significant advantage, enabling unified management and consistency.

- **Infrastructure code is easy to maintain and understand without any Cloud knowledge:** This is **not** a benefit of using Terraform. While Terraform does aim to simplify infrastructure management through human-readable configuration files, understanding cloud concepts and the underlying infrastructure is still essential for effectively using IaC tools.

- **The human-readable configuration language helps you write infrastructure code quickly:** Terraform's configuration language is designed to be clear and readable, which helps in writing and understanding infrastructure code efficiently.

### Summary

The statement "Infrastructure code is easy to maintain and understand without any Cloud knowledge" is not a benefit of using IaC tools like Terraform, as a certain level of cloud knowledge is still necessary to effectively manage and understand infrastructure.
