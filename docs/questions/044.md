# Understanding Terraform CLI Default Backend

## Question

Which backend does the Terraform CLI use by default?

- [ ] Depends on the cloud provider configured
- [ ] HTTP
- [ ] Remote
- [ ] Terraform Cloud
- [x] Local

## Explanation of Answers

### Depends on the cloud provider configured

**Explanation:** The default backend used by Terraform does not depend on the cloud provider configured in the Terraform configuration. Instead, it defaults to a specific backend regardless of the cloud provider.

### HTTP

**Explanation:** HTTP is not a specific backend type in Terraform. While HTTP might be used as a protocol for communication with certain backends, it is not itself a backend option for storing state.

### Remote

**Explanation:** Remote backends in Terraform, such as S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage, are used to store state files in a remote location. However, Terraform does not use a remote backend by default; it requires explicit configuration to specify a remote backend.

### Terraform Cloud

**Explanation:** Terraform Cloud is a managed service offered by HashiCorp that provides a remote backend for Terraform state and additional features like collaboration and policy enforcement. However, it is not the default backend used by Terraform CLI; it needs to be explicitly configured.

### Local

**Explanation:** By default, the Terraform CLI uses the **Local** backend. This means that Terraform stores the state file (`terraform.tfstate`) in the local directory where the Terraform command is run. This default behavior is simple and suitable for local development or small-scale projects, but for larger teams or production environments, you might prefer to configure a remote backend.
