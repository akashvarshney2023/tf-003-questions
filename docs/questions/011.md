### What feature stops multiple users from operating on the Terraform state at the same time?

- State locking
- Version control
- Provider constraints
- Remote backends

The feature that stops multiple users from operating on the Terraform state at the same time is **state locking**.

### State Locking
- **State locking** is a mechanism that ensures only one Terraform operation (e.g., `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`) can modify the state file at any given time.
- This prevents concurrent operations from conflicting and potentially corrupting the state file.
- State locking is typically handled by remote backends that support it, such as Amazon S3 with DynamoDB, Terraform Cloud, or HashiCorp Consul.

### Example with Remote Backend
When using a remote backend that supports state locking, such as AWS S3 with DynamoDB, the configuration might look like this:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "path/to/my/key"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    dynamodb_table = "my-lock-table"
  }
}
```

In this configuration:
- The `s3` backend is used to store the state file in an S3 bucket.
- The `dynamodb_table` is used to manage state locking.

### Why Not the Other Options?

- **Version control**: While version control systems (like Git) are useful for tracking changes to your Terraform configuration files, they do not handle state locking.
- **Provider constraints**: These are used to specify which versions of a provider are compatible with your configuration, but they do not prevent concurrent operations on the state file.
- **Remote backends**: While remote backends can support state locking, it is the state locking feature itself that provides the necessary protection against concurrent operations.

Therefore, **state locking** is the correct answer to ensure that multiple users cannot operate on the Terraform state simultaneously.
