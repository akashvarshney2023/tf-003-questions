# Terraform Use Case

## Which of the following describes the Terraform use case?

- [x] Provisioning infrastructure in both Azure and AWS
- [ ] Enforce compliance and governance policies before any infrastructure changes
- [ ] Deploy a Kubernetes cluster and manage its resources
- [x] All of the above

### Answer Explanation

- **Provisioning infrastructure in both Azure and AWS:** Terraform is commonly used for provisioning infrastructure across multiple cloud providers, including both Azure and AWS. It allows you to define and manage cloud resources in a consistent way regardless of the provider.

- **Enforce compliance and governance policies before any infrastructure changes:** While Terraform itself does not enforce compliance and governance policies, it integrates with tools like Sentinel (in Terraform Cloud) and third-party solutions to help enforce such policies. Terraform provides the capability to define infrastructure, but compliance and governance enforcement often require additional tools.

- **Deploy a Kubernetes cluster and manage its resources:** Terraform can be used to provision Kubernetes clusters and manage their resources. It supports Kubernetes as a provider, allowing users to define and manage Kubernetes resources within their infrastructure code.

- **All of the above:** Since Terraform supports provisioning infrastructure across multiple cloud providers, can be used to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters, and can be integrated with other tools for compliance and governance, the most accurate description of Terraform's use cases is "All of the above."

### Summary

Terraform is versatile in managing infrastructure across different cloud platforms and can be used for a variety of tasks, including provisioning infrastructure, deploying Kubernetes clusters, and integrating with compliance and governance tools.
