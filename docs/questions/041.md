#  Workflow for Deploying New Infrastructure with Terraform

## Question
What is the workflow for deploying new infrastructure with Terraform?

- [ ] Write Terraform configuration, run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory or workspace, and run `terraform apply`
- [ ] Write Terraform configuration, run `terraform show` to view proposed changes, and `terraform apply` to create new infrastructure
- [ ] Write Terraform configuration, run `terraform apply` to create infrastructure, use `terraform validate` to confirm Terraform deployed resources correctly
- [ ] Write Terraform configuration, run `terraform plan` to initialize the working directory or workspace, and `terraform apply` to create the infrastructure

## Answer

### **Write Terraform configuration, run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory or workspace, and run `terraform apply`**

**Explanation**:
The standard workflow for deploying new infrastructure with Terraform involves several steps. Here are the correct steps:

1. **Write Terraform Configuration**: Define the infrastructure resources in `.tf` files using HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).

2. **Run `terraform init`**: This command initializes the working directory containing the Terraform configuration files. It downloads necessary provider plugins and sets up the backend for state storage if specified.

3. **Run `terraform plan`** (Not listed in options but important): This optional but recommended step creates an execution plan, showing what actions Terraform will take to achieve the desired state described in the configuration. It allows you to review changes before applying them.

4. **Run `terraform apply`**: This command applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration. Terraform will execute the actions proposed by the plan to create, update, or delete infrastructure resources.

Here are the options explained:

- **Write Terraform configuration, run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory or workspace, and run `terraform apply`**:
  This is mostly correct. However, it skips the `terraform plan` step, which is important for reviewing proposed changes.

- **Write Terraform configuration, run `terraform show` to view proposed changes, and `terraform apply` to create new infrastructure**:
  This is incorrect. `terraform show` is used to display information about the state or a saved plan, not to view proposed changes before applying them.

- **Write Terraform configuration, run `terraform apply` to create infrastructure, use `terraform validate` to confirm Terraform deployed resources correctly**:
  This is incorrect. `terraform validate` is used to check the syntax and validity of the configuration files before applying them, not after.

- **Write Terraform configuration, run `terraform plan` to initialize the working directory or workspace, and `terraform apply` to create the infrastructure**:
  This is incorrect. `terraform plan` is used to create an execution plan, not to initialize the working directory.

Therefore, the best choice among the given options is:

- [x] Write Terraform configuration, run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory or workspace, and run `terraform apply`

## Summary

The workflow for deploying new infrastructure with Terraform involves writing the configuration, running `terraform init` to initialize the working directory, optionally running `terraform plan` to review proposed changes, and finally running `terraform apply` to create the infrastructure.
