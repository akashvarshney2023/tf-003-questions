# Complex Types in Terraform

## Question

What are two complex types in Terraform? (Choose 2 answers)

- [x] A Collection Type
- [x] A Structural Type
- [ ] A String Type
- [ ] A float64 type

## Explanation

**A Structural Type**

**Explanation:** **Structural types** in Terraform, such as `object` and `tuple`, are used to group multiple values into a single cohesive unit. These types allow you to define complex, structured variables with various attributes, making them essential for managing more sophisticated configurations.

**A Collection Type**

**Explanation:** **Collection types** include `list`, `map`, and `set`. They are used to handle groups of values where each value is of the same type (for `list` and `set`) or where each value is associated with a unique key (for `map`). Collection types are considered complex because they manage multiple values within a single variable.

**Other Options:**

- **A String Type:** String is a basic type in Terraform and is not considered complex. It represents a single value of text.

- **A float64 type:** `float64` is a basic numerical type in Terraform and is not classified as a complex type. It represents a single floating-point number.

### Summary

Two examples of complex types in Terraform are **`Structural Type`** and **`Collection Type`**. These types help in managing and organizing multiple values within a single variable, providing flexibility and structure in Terraform configurations.
