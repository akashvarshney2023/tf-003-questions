## Why does this backend configuration not follow best practices?
![alt text](../assets/022.png)

- [ ] An alias meta-argument should be included in backend blocks whenever possible
- [ ] You should use the local enhanced storage backend whenever possible
- [ ] You should not store credentials in Terraform configuration
- [ ] The backend configuration should contain multiple credentials so that more than one user can execute terraform plan and terraform apply

The backend configuration shown in the image does not follow best practices because:

- [ ] **An alias meta-argument should be included in backend blocks whenever possible**
  - This is incorrect. Aliases are typically used with providers, not backend configurations.

- [ ] **You should use the local enhanced storage backend whenever possible**
  - This is incorrect. Using a remote backend like S3 is often preferred for storing state files, especially in team environments, to ensure centralized and consistent state management.

- [x] **You should not store credentials in Terraform configuration**
  - This is the correct option. Storing sensitive information such as access keys and secret keys directly in the Terraform configuration is not a best practice. Instead, credentials should be managed securely using environment variables, a credential manager, or IAM roles.

- [ ] **The backend configuration should contain multiple credentials so that more than one user can execute terraform plan and terraform apply**
  - This is incorrect. Backend configurations should not contain multiple sets of credentials. Instead, IAM roles and policies should be used to grant necessary permissions to different users.
