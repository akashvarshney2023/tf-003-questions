# Terraform Cloud vs. Other State Backends

## Question

How does the Terraform Cloud integration differ from other state backends such as S3, Consul, etc.?

- [x] It can execute Terraform runs on dedicated infrastructure in Terraform Cloud
- [ ] It doesn't show the output of a terraform apply locally
- [ ] It is only available to paying customers
- [ ] All of the above

## Explanation

**It can execute Terraform runs on dedicated infrastructure in Terraform Cloud**

**Explanation:** This is a correct statement. Terraform Cloud provides dedicated infrastructure for executing Terraform runs. Unlike other state backends such as S3 or Consul, which only handle state storage, Terraform Cloud also provides a managed environment to execute Terraform operations. This includes features like remote execution, collaboration, and access controls.

**It doesn't show the output of a terraform apply locally**

**Explanation:** This is not accurate. While Terraform Cloud handles the execution of `terraform apply`, you can still see the output locally if you are using the CLI with appropriate configurations. The output of Terraform runs in Terraform Cloud is also accessible through the Terraform Cloud web interface.

**It is only available to paying customers**

**Explanation:** This is partially true but not a defining characteristic of Terraform Cloud's integration with Terraform. Terraform Cloud has both free and paid tiers. The free tier offers many features, but some advanced capabilities and higher usage limits are available only in the paid plans. However, the availability of a free tier does not distinguish Terraform Cloud from other state backends in terms of core functionality.

**All of the above**

**Explanation:** Since not all the statements are accurate, this option is not correct. Only the first statement accurately describes a key difference between Terraform Cloud and other state backends.

### Summary

The key difference between Terraform Cloud and other state backends like S3 or Consul is that **Terraform Cloud can execute Terraform runs on dedicated infrastructure in Terraform Cloud**. Other state backends primarily focus on state storage and do not provide the same level of integrated execution and management features.
