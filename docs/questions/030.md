- [x] **`terraform refresh -upgrade`**: Not a valid option for upgrading plugins.

### **`terraform apply -upgrade`**

**Explanation**:
The `terraform apply` command is used to apply changes to your infrastructure based on the configuration files. It does not have an `-upgrade` option and is not used for upgrading plugins. This command focuses on making changes to the infrastructure rather than managing plugin versions.

### **`terraform init -upgrade`**

**Explanation**:
The `terraform init` command initializes a Terraform configuration and downloads the necessary provider plugins. The `-upgrade` option with `terraform init` will upgrade the provider plugins to the latest available versions according to the constraints in the configuration files. This is the correct command for ensuring plugins are updated.

- [ ] **`terraform init -upgrade`**: Correct command for upgrading plugins.

### **`terraform providers -upgrade`**

**Explanation**:
The `terraform providers` command is used to display the provider information, but it does not include an `-upgrade` option. This command provides details about the providers used in the configuration but does not handle upgrading them.

- [x] **`terraform providers -upgrade`**: Not a valid command for upgrading plugins.
