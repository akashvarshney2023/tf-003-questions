# Question and Answer: Terraform `apply -refresh-only`

## Question
What does Terraform **not** reference when running the command `terraform apply -refresh-only`?

- [ ] State file
- [ ] Credentials
- [ ] Cloud provider
- [ ] Terraform resource definitions in configuration files

## Answer

### **Credentials**

**Explanation**:
While Terraform needs valid credentials to connect to the cloud provider and fetch the current state of resources, it does not reference or directly manipulate credentials during the `terraform apply -refresh-only` operation. The credentials are required for access but are not part of the operation’s focus. The command primarily deals with refreshing the state file, not credential management.

- [x] **Credentials**: Not referenced directly.

### **Cloud Provider**

**Explanation**:
Terraform interacts with the cloud provider to refresh the state of resources. However, it does not reference or modify the cloud provider’s configuration settings directly. The command queries the provider for the current state of the resources and updates the state file based on this information. The cloud provider settings themselves are not the focus of the `refresh-only` operation.

- [x] **Cloud Provider**: Not referenced directly.

### **Terraform Resource Definitions in Configuration Files**

**Explanation**:
The `terraform apply -refresh-only` command does not reference or alter the resource definitions specified in the configuration files. Its sole purpose is to update the state file with the most recent information from the infrastructure. The configurations remain unchanged during this operation.

- [x] **Terraform Resource Definitions**: Not referenced or altered.

### **State File**

**Explanation**:
Contrary to the other options, the state file is directly referenced and updated during the `terraform apply -refresh-only` operation. The command updates the state file with the latest information about the resources from the cloud provider but does not make changes to the infrastructure itself.

- [ ] **State File**: Referenced and updated.

## Summary

- **Credentials**: Not referenced directly.
- **Cloud Provider**: Not referenced directly.
- **Terraform Resource Definitions**: Not referenced or altered.
- **State File**: Referenced and updated with the latest resource information.

The `terraform apply -refresh-only` command focuses on synchronizing the state file with the current state of the infrastructure, without making changes to the resources or configuration files.
