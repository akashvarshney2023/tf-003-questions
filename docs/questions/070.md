# Terraform Formatting Command

## Question

Running `terraform fmt` without any flags in a directory with Terraform configuration files checks the formatting of those files without changing their contents.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Explanation

**False**

**Explanation:** The `terraform fmt` command is used to automatically format Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style. Running `terraform fmt` without any flags will format the files in the directory and its subdirectories, updating the files to follow the standard Terraform style guidelines. 

Here's what happens:

- **Formatting Changes:** If `terraform fmt` detects that the configuration files do not adhere to the standard formatting, it will modify the files to apply the correct format. This includes adjusting indentation, spacing, and other style elements.
  
- **No Check-Only Option:** There is no built-in flag for `terraform fmt` to check the formatting without making changes. To check whether files are formatted correctly without applying changes, you would use `terraform fmt -check` which only reports the formatting issues without modifying the files.

**Other Considerations:**

- **`terraform fmt -check`**: This flag will check the formatting and report whether files need to be formatted without actually changing them.

### Summary

Running `terraform fmt` without any flags will format the Terraform configuration files to ensure they follow the standard style guidelines and will change their contents if necessary. To check formatting without making changes, you would use `terraform fmt -check`.
