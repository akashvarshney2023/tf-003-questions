# Understanding Terraform Modules

## Question

Which of the following statements about Terraform modules is not true?

- [ ] Modules can call other modules
- [ ] A module is a container for one or more resources
- [x] Modules must be publicly accessible
- [ ] You can call the same module multiple times

## Explanation

### Modules can call other modules

**Explanation:** This statement is true. Terraform modules can indeed call other modules. This allows for creating complex infrastructure setups by reusing and composing smaller modules together, which promotes modularity and reusability.

### A module is a container for one or more resources

**Explanation:** This statement is true. A Terraform module is essentially a container that holds one or more resources, along with any variables, outputs, and other configurations. Modules help organize and manage configurations in a modular and reusable way.

### Modules must be publicly accessible

**Explanation:** This statement is not true. Modules do not have to be publicly accessible. While many modules are shared publicly through platforms like the Terraform Registry, modules can be private and stored locally or in private repositories. You can use private modules for internal projects or within an organization without exposing them publicly.

### You can call the same module multiple times

**Explanation:** This statement is true. You can call the same module multiple times within the same configuration, possibly with different inputs, to create multiple instances of the same resource or set of resources. This feature supports creating multiple instances of similar infrastructure components, such as multiple VPCs or compute instances.

### Summary

The statement that **"Modules must be publicly accessible"** is not true. Terraform modules can be private, local, or shared publicly, depending on your needs and configuration.
