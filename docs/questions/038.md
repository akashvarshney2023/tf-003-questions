# Terraform Style Convention for Indenting

## Question
What is the Terraform style convention for indenting a nesting level compared to the one above it?

- [ ] With a tab
- [ ] With two spaces
- [ ] With four spaces
- [ ] With three spaces

## Answer

### **With two spaces**

**Explanation**:
The Terraform style convention for indenting a nesting level is to use two spaces. This convention helps maintain readability and consistency across Terraform configuration files. Using spaces instead of tabs ensures that the code looks the same in different editors and environments, preventing potential formatting issues.

Here are the options explained:

- **With a tab**:
  While some coding styles use tabs for indentation, Terraform's convention is to use spaces for consistency.

- **With two spaces**:
  This is the correct convention for Terraform. Each nesting level should be indented with two spaces.

- **With four spaces**:
  Four spaces are commonly used in other programming languages, but Terraform specifically recommends two spaces for indentation.

- **With three spaces**:
  Three spaces are uncommon and not part of the Terraform style convention.

Therefore, the correct indentation style for Terraform is to use two spaces for each nesting level.

- [ ] With a tab
- [x] With two spaces
- [ ] With four spaces
- [ ] With three spaces

## Summary

The Terraform style convention for indenting a nesting level is to use two spaces. This ensures readability and consistency across configuration files.
