# Features of Terraform Cloud

## Question

Which of these are features of Terraform Cloud? Choose two correct answers.

- [ ] Automated infrastructure deployment visualization
- [ ] Automatic backups
- [x] A web-based user interface (UI)
- [x] Remote state storage

## Explanation

**Automated infrastructure deployment visualization**

**Explanation:** This feature is not specifically offered by Terraform Cloud. While Terraform Cloud provides collaboration and integration features, automated infrastructure deployment visualization is not a distinct feature. Visualization tools for infrastructure typically require separate solutions or integrations.

**Automatic backups**

**Explanation:** Terraform Cloud does not explicitly offer automatic backups as a feature. However, Terraform Cloud does manage state files and keeps a history of changes, which can act similarly to backups. Explicit backup functionality for other types of data or configuration would need to be managed separately.

**A web-based user interface (UI)**

**Explanation:** This is a correct answer. Terraform Cloud provides a web-based user interface, which allows users to manage their Terraform configurations, states, and runs through a browser. This UI facilitates easier collaboration, visibility, and management of Terraform resources.

**Remote state storage**

**Explanation:** This is a correct answer. One of the key features of Terraform Cloud is remote state storage. Terraform Cloud securely stores Terraform state files remotely, providing consistency, security, and easy access to state files for teams working on the same infrastructure.

### Summary

The correct answers are:
- A web-based user interface (UI)
- Remote state storage

These features help teams collaborate more effectively and manage their Terraform configurations and state files securely and efficiently.
