# Examples of Infrastructure as Code

## Question

Which are examples of infrastructure as code? Choose two correct answers.

- [ ] Cloned virtual machine images
- [x] Versioned configuration files
- [ ] Change management database records
- [x] Docker files

## Explanation

**Versioned configuration files**

**Explanation:** **Versioned configuration files** are a core example of infrastructure as code (IaC). These files, such as Terraform `.tf` files, AWS CloudFormation templates, or Ansible playbooks, define infrastructure in a declarative manner and can be version-controlled. This allows teams to track changes, roll back to previous versions, and manage infrastructure consistently.

**Docker files**

**Explanation:** **Docker files** are also considered a part of infrastructure as code. Dockerfiles are scripts that define the environment and the steps to build Docker images. They ensure that the application's environment is consistent and reproducible, which aligns with the IaC principle of managing infrastructure through code.

**Other Options:**

- **Cloned virtual machine images:** Cloning VM images is a method of duplicating existing setups but is not considered infrastructure as code. IaC focuses on defining infrastructure using code rather than duplicating existing configurations.

- **Change management database records:** Change management records are used to track changes in infrastructure but are not themselves infrastructure as code. IaC involves defining and managing infrastructure configurations through code.

### Summary

**Versioned configuration files** and **Docker files** are examples of infrastructure as code. They involve defining and managing infrastructure or environments through code, enabling repeatability and version control.
