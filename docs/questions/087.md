# Terraform Variable Types for Key/Value Pairs

## Question

Which variable type can be used in Terraform for key/value pairs?

- [ ] list
- [ ] tuple
- [x] map
- [ ] set

## Explanation

**map**

**Explanation:** The **`map`** variable type is used in Terraform for key/value pairs. It allows you to define a collection where each element is a key associated with a value, making it suitable for representing dictionaries or associative arrays.

**Other Options:**

- **list:** A `list` is an ordered collection of values where each value can be accessed by its index. It does not support key/value pairs.

- **tuple:** A `tuple` is an ordered collection of elements where each element can be of a different type. It is not designed for key/value pairs but rather for fixed-size, ordered collections.

- **set:** A `set` is an unordered collection of unique values. It does not support key/value pairs and is used for collections where the order is not important and duplicates are not allowed.

### Summary

The **`map`** variable type in Terraform is used for key/value pairs, allowing you to store and manage data in a structured way with keys associated with corresponding values.
