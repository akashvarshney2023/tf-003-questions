# Forcing a Specific Version of Required Providers

**How do you force users to use a particular version of required providers in your Terraform code?**

- [ ] terraform { required_providers { aws = { source = “hashicorp/aws” version = “3.74.1” } } }
- [ ] terraform { aws = { source = “hashicorp/aws” version = “~>3.74.1” } }
- [ ] aws = { source = “hashicorp/aws” version = “3.74.1” }
- [x] terraform { required_providers { aws = { source = “hashicorp/aws” version = “~>3.74.1” } } }

### Explanation

To specify and enforce a particular version of a provider in Terraform, you use the `required_providers` block within the `terraform` block in your configuration. The correct syntax is:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.74.1"
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration ensures that Terraform uses the AWS provider version `3.74.1` and allows for any patch or minor updates within the `3.74.x` range but prevents updates to `3.75.0` or higher.

## Summary

The `required_providers` block within the `terraform` block, combined with the version constraint operator `~>`, enforces the use of a specific version range for providers, ensuring compatibility and control over the provider versions used in your Terraform configurations.
