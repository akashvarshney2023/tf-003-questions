# Understanding the `required_version` Constraint

**What is a more accurate description of the below version constraint?**

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.4.7"
}
```

- [ ] All the Terraform providers are should have a minimum 1.4.7 version
- [ ] Terraform version older than 1.4.7 are not supported by Hashicorp
- [x] Terraform version older than 1.4.7 will produce an error running this configuration
- [ ] The minimum version of the application using Terraform should be 1.4.7

### Explanation

The `required_version` constraint specifies the minimum version of Terraform that is required to run the configuration. In this case:

```hcl
required_version = ">= 1.4.7"
```

This means that Terraform versions **older than 1.4.7** will not be able to run this configuration and will produce an error if attempted. Terraform will enforce this version requirement, ensuring that only compatible versions of Terraform are used.

## Summary

The `required_version = ">= 1.4.7"` constraint ensures that any version of Terraform **older than 1.4.7** will result in an error when running the configuration. This constraint helps maintain compatibility and ensures that newer features or fixes available in versions `1.4.7` and later are utilized.
