# Valid Versions for Google Cloud Provider

**What is the provider version of Google Cloud being used in Terraform? Select all valid options.**

```hcl
provider "google" {
  version = "~> 1.9.0"
}
```

- [x] 1.9.1
- [ ] 1.10.0
- [ ] 1.8.0
- [x] 1.9.9

### Explanation

The version constraint `~> 1.9.0` specifies that:

- The provider version must be **greater than or equal to 1.9.0**.
- The provider version must be **less than 2.0.0**.

This allows for any version from `1.9.0` up to, but not including, `2.0.0`. Therefore, valid versions include:

- `1.9.1` and `1.9.9` (both are within the specified range)
- `1.10.0` (exceeds the upper bound of `1.9.x`)
- `1.8.0` (below the lower bound of `1.9.0`)

## Summary

The version constraint `~> 1.9.0` allows for updates within the `1.9.x` range, including versions like `1.9.1` and `1.9.9`, but excludes `1.10.0` and `1.8.0` due to their respective bounds.
