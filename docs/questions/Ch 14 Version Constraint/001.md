# Pessimistic Constraint Operator for Version Bounds

## Question

**Which version constraint should you use to set both a lower and upper bound on versions for each provider, also known as the pessimistic constraint operator?**

- [ ] >=
- [x] ~>
- [ ] !=
- [ ] <>

## Explanation

### `~>` Operator

The `~>` operator, known as the pessimistic constraint operator, is used to set both a lower and upper bound on versions. This operator allows for patch-level updates but prevents breaking changes that might occur with higher version increments. It ensures compatibility within a specific version range.

**Example:**

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  version = "~> 2.7"
}
```

In this example, the acceptable versions are `2.7.x`, where `x` can be any patch version. This means versions `2.7.0`, `2.7.1`, etc., are acceptable, but `2.8.0` and higher are not.

### Other Operators

#### `>=` Operator

The `>=` operator sets a lower bound for versions. It ensures that the version of the provider or module is greater than or equal to the specified version.

**Example:**

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  version = ">= 2.0"
}
```

In this example, any version of the AWS provider that is `2.0` or higher is acceptable.

#### `!=` Operator

The `!=` operator is used to exclude specific versions. It ensures that the specified version is not used.

**Example:**

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  version = "!= 2.5.0"
}
```

In this example, any version of the AWS provider except `2.5.0` is acceptable.

#### `<>` Operator

The `<>` operator is not a valid version constraint in Terraform. It is not used for specifying version constraints.

## Summary

To set both a lower and upper bound on versions for each provider in Terraform, you should use the `~>` operator. This pessimistic constraint operator allows for safe updates within a specific version range, ensuring compatibility and stability of your Terraform configurations.
