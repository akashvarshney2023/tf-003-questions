# Understanding the `~>` Operator

**What does this symbol `version = "~> 1.0"` mean when defining versions?**

- [ ] > 1.0 and < 2.0
- [x] >= 1.0 and < 2.0
- [ ] >= 1.0 and <= 2.0
- [ ] > 1.0.0 and < 2.0.0

### Explanation

The `~>` operator, known as the pessimistic constraint operator, specifies a range of acceptable versions. When you use `version = "~> 1.0"`, it means:

- The version must be **greater than or equal to 1.0**.
- The version must be **less than 2.0**.

This constraint allows for minor and patch updates to `1.0.x` but excludes updates to `2.0.0` or higher, ensuring compatibility within the `1.x` range while avoiding potentially breaking changes introduced in major version updates.

## Summary

The `~>` operator in `version = "~> 1.0"` ensures that the provider version is within the `1.0.x` range, allowing for updates that are backward-compatible while preventing major version changes that could introduce breaking changes.
