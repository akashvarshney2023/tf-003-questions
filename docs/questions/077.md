# Determining Dependencies in Terraform

## Question

How does Terraform determine dependencies between resources?

- [ ] Terraform requires resource dependencies to be defined as modules and sourced in order
- [x] Terraform automatically builds a resource graph based on resources, provisioners, special meta-parameters, and the state file (if present)
- [ ] Terraform requires resources in a configuration to be listed in the order they will be created to determine dependencies
- [ ] Terraform requires all dependencies between resources to be specified using the depends_on parameter

## Explanation

**Terraform automatically builds a resource graph based on resources, provisioners, special meta-parameters, and the state file (if present)**

**Explanation:** Terraform determines dependencies between resources by automatically building a dependency graph. This graph is based on the relationships defined in the Terraform configuration files, including the resources, provisioners, special meta-parameters, and, if available, the state file. Terraform uses this graph to plan and execute resource creation and updates in the correct order, ensuring that dependencies are respected.

**Other Options:**

- **Terraform requires resource dependencies to be defined as modules and sourced in order:** This is not necessary for Terraform to determine dependencies. While modules can define resources and their relationships, Terraform does not require modules to be sourced in a specific order to determine dependencies.

- **Terraform requires resources in a configuration to be listed in the order they will be created to determine dependencies:** Terraform does not rely on the order of resource definitions in the configuration file to determine dependencies. Instead, it uses the dependency graph.

- **Terraform requires all dependencies between resources to be specified using the depends_on parameter:** While the `depends_on` parameter can explicitly specify dependencies, Terraform generally determines dependencies automatically through the resource graph, without requiring every dependency to be explicitly defined.

### Summary

Terraform determines dependencies between resources by **automatically building a resource graph** based on resources, provisioners, special meta-parameters, and the state file, if present. This approach allows Terraform to manage the creation and updating of resources in the correct order based on their interdependencies.
