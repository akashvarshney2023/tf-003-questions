# Question and Answer: Finding the Public IP Address of a Deployed Resource

## Question
You have deployed a new webapp with a public IP address on a cloud provider. However, you did not create any outputs for your code.
What is the best method to quickly find the IP address of the resource you deployed?

- [ ] In a new folder, use the `terraform_remote_state` data source to load in the state file, then write an output for each resource that you find in the state file
- [ ] Run `terraform state list` to find the name of the resource, then `terraform state show` to find the attributes including the public IP address
- [ ] Run `terraform output ip_address` to view the result
- [ ] Run `terraform destroy` then `terraform apply` and look for the IP address in stdout

## Answer

### **In a new folder, use the `terraform_remote_state` data source to load in the state file, then write an output for each resource that you find in the state file**

**Explanation**:
Using `terraform_remote_state` to load the state file and then creating outputs for each resource is a valid approach but is more complex and time-consuming. This method involves setting up a new Terraform configuration, defining a `terraform_remote_state` data source, and then writing new output blocks to retrieve the required information. It is more cumbersome compared to other methods when you only need to find an IP address quickly.

- [x] **In a new folder, use the `terraform_remote_state` data source**: Not the quickest method.

### **Run `terraform state list` to find the name of the resource, then `terraform state show` to find the attributes including the public IP address**

**Explanation**:
This is an effective method for quickly locating the IP address of a resource. By using `terraform state list`, you can find the resource name, and then `terraform state show` provides detailed information, including attributes such as the public IP address. This method does not require modifying existing configurations and is efficient for quickly retrieving the required information.

- [ ] **Run `terraform state list` and `terraform state show`**: Quick and effective method.

### **Run `terraform output ip_address` to view the result**

**Explanation**:
The `terraform output` command is used to display the output values defined in your Terraform configuration. However, since you did not create any outputs for your code, this method will not work because there are no output values defined to display.

- [x] **Run `terraform output ip_address`**: Will not work if no outputs are defined.

### **Run `terraform destroy` then `terraform apply` and look for the IP address in stdout**

**Explanation**:
Running `terraform destroy` followed by `terraform apply` will recreate your resources, which is not a recommended approach for just retrieving the IP address. This method is destructive, potentially costly, and time-consuming, and it could lead to unintended changes or loss of data. It should be avoided if you only need to retrieve information.

- [x] **Run `terraform destroy` and `terraform apply`**: Not a recommended or quick method.

## Summary

- **In a new folder, use the `terraform_remote_state` data source**: Not the quickest method.
- **Run `terraform state list` and `terraform state show`**: Quick and effective method.
- **Run `terraform output ip_address`**: Will not work if no outputs are defined.
- **Run `terraform destroy` and `terraform apply`**: Not a recommended or quick method.

The best method to quickly find the public IP address of the deployed resource is to use `terraform state list` to locate the resource and `terraform state show` to view its attributes, including the IP address.
