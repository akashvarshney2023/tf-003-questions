## What are the benefits of Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform?

- [ ] Manage and track infrastructure
- [ ] Automate infrastructure changes
- [ ] Support reusable configuration
- [ ] Collaboration using VCS (version control system)
- [x] All of the above

### Answer Explanation

Terraform and other Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools offer numerous benefits, including:

- **Manage and Track Infrastructure:** IaC tools like Terraform allow you to define your infrastructure in code, making it easier to manage, version, and track changes over time.
  
- **Automate Infrastructure Changes:** Terraform automates the process of provisioning, updating, and managing infrastructure, reducing the risk of manual errors and increasing efficiency.
  
- **Support Reusable Configuration:** Terraform configurations can be reused across different environments, such as development, staging, and production, promoting consistency and reducing duplication of effort.
  
- **Collaboration using VCS (Version Control System):** By storing Terraform configurations in a version control system, teams can collaborate more effectively, review changes, and maintain a history of infrastructure modifications.

The correct answer is **All of the above**, as Terraform provides all these benefits.
