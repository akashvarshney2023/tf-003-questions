# Benefits of Using an Infrastructure as Code Tool like Terraform

## What are the benefits of using an “Infrastructure as Code” tool like Terraform? (Select three)

- [ ] An imperative approach, offers flexibility to describe each step you want IaC to follow to reach the desired state
- [x] You can commit your configurations to version control to safely collaborate on infrastructure
- [x] The human-readable configuration language helps you write infrastructure code quickly
- [x] Terraform can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms

### Answer Explanation

- **You can commit your configurations to version control to safely collaborate on infrastructure:** Committing Terraform configurations to version control systems (e.g., Git) allows for effective team collaboration, version tracking, and rollback capabilities.

- **The human-readable configuration language helps you write infrastructure code quickly:** Terraform uses a declarative language that is designed to be easy to read and write, which accelerates the process of creating and managing infrastructure.

- **Terraform can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms:** Terraform's ability to manage infrastructure across various cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) allows for consistent and unified infrastructure management.

- **An imperative approach, offers flexibility to describe each step you want IaC to follow to reach the desired state:** This is not a benefit of Terraform. Terraform employs a declarative approach, where you specify the desired end state of your infrastructure, and Terraform handles the steps to achieve that state. The imperative approach, which describes each step in detail, is not a feature of Terraform.

### Summary

The benefits of using Terraform as an Infrastructure as Code tool include its integration with version control systems, its human-readable configuration language, and its support for managing infrastructure across multiple cloud platforms. The imperative approach, which is not used by Terraform, is not considered a benefit.
