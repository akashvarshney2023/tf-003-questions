# Checking Terraform Code Formatting

## Question
Which command should you run to check if all code in a Terraform configuration that references multiple modules is properly formatted without making changes?

- [ ] `terraform fmt -write-false`
- [ ] `terraform fmt -list -recursive`
- [ ] `terraform fmt -check -recursive`
- [ ] `terraform fmt -check`

## Answer

### **`terraform fmt -check -recursive`**

**Explanation**:
The `terraform fmt` command is used to rewrite Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style. To check if the code is properly formatted without making any changes, you can use the `-check` option.
