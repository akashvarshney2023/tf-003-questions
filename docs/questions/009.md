### Outside of the required_providers block, Terraform configurations always refer to providers by their local names.

- True
- False
--- 

Terraform configurations can indeed refer to providers by either their local names or their source addresses outside of the `required_providers` block. Here's a more detailed explanation:

### Local Names vs. Source Addresses

- **Local Names**:
  - A short, convenient alias used to refer to the provider throughout the configuration.
  - Example: `aws`

- **Source Addresses**:
  - A global identifier for the provider in the format `registry.terraform.io/namespace/type`.
  - Example: `registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws`

### Example Usage

1. **Using Local Names**:
   - Commonly used and concise.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     terraform {
       required_providers {
         aws = {
           source  = "hashicorp/aws"
           version = "~> 3.0"
         }
       }
     }

     provider "aws" {
       region = "us-west-2"
     }

     resource "aws_instance" "example" {
       ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
       instance_type = "t2.micro"
     }
     ```

2. **Using Source Addresses**:
   - More explicit and useful for clarity, especially in larger configurations or when dealing with multiple providers.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     terraform {
       required_providers {
         aws = {
           source  = "hashicorp/aws"
           version = "~> 3.0"
         }
       }
     }

     provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws" {
       region = "us-west-2"
     }

     resource "aws_instance" "example" {
       provider     = "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws"
       ami          = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
       instance_type = "t2.micro"
     }
     ```

### Summary
- Terraform configurations can refer to providers by their local names (e.g., `aws`) or their source addresses (e.g., `registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws`).
- Local names are used for simplicity, while source addresses provide explicit clarity.

Terraform allows for flexibility in how providers are referenced within configurations.So the answer is **false** .
