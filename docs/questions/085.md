# Terraform Local Backend State Storage

## Question

Where does the Terraform local backend store its state?

- [ ] In the Terraform file
- [ ] In the /tmp directory
- [ ] In the terraform.tfstate file
- [ ] In the user's terraform.state file

## Explanation

**In the terraform.tfstate file**

**Explanation:** The **local backend** in Terraform stores its state in a file named **`terraform.tfstate`**. This file is typically located in the same directory where the Terraform configuration files (`*.tf`) are located. The `terraform.tfstate` file contains the current state of the infrastructure managed by Terraform and is used to keep track of resource mappings and metadata.

**Other Options:**

- **In the Terraform file:** Terraform configurations are stored in `.tf` files, which define the desired state of the infrastructure but do not store the state itself.

- **In the /tmp directory:** The `/tmp` directory is a temporary storage location and is not used by Terraform for storing the state file by default.

- **In the user's terraform.state file:** While the file might be named `terraform.state`, the standard filename for the local backend state file is `terraform.tfstate`. Custom names or locations are not the default behavior.

### Summary

The Terraform local backend stores its state in the **`terraform.tfstate`** file, located in the working directory of the Terraform configuration.
