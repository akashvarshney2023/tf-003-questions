# Best Practices for Storing Secret Data in Version Control

## Question

It is best practice to store secret data in the same version control repository as your Terraform configuration.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Explanation

**False**

**Explanation:** Storing secret data, such as API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information, in the same version control repository as your Terraform configuration is **not** considered best practice. Here’s why:

1. **Security Risks**: Storing secrets in version control repositories can expose them to unauthorized access. Version control systems, especially if they are shared or public, may inadvertently leak sensitive information to people who should not have access.

2. **Version History**: Secrets stored in version control are part of the repository’s history. Even if you delete them from the latest version, they remain in the version history and can potentially be retrieved by someone with access to the repository.

3. **Best Practices**: The recommended approach is to use dedicated secret management tools or services. Examples include AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, and Google Secret Manager. These tools are designed to securely store and manage sensitive information, and they integrate with Terraform to provide secrets dynamically during deployments.

4. **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Managing secrets through external services helps keep environment-specific configurations isolated and secure. Secrets can be injected into your infrastructure dynamically without hardcoding them into your configuration files.

### Recommended Practices

- **Use Secret Management Tools**: Leverage tools specifically designed for secret management.
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to pass sensitive data securely into Terraform.
- **Terraform Variables**: For sensitive variables, consider using Terraform's `sensitive` attribute to prevent their values from being displayed in plan output or logs.
