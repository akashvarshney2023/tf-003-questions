# Specifying a Module's Version in the Terraform Module Registry

## Question

How do you specify a module's version when publishing it to the public Terraform Module Registry?

- [ ] Configure it in the module's Terraform code
- [ ] Mention it on the module's configuration page on the Terraform Module Registry
- [ ] The Terraform Module Registry does not support versioning modules
- [x] Tag a release in the associated repo

## Explanation

**Tag a release in the associated repo**

**Explanation:** When publishing a module to the public Terraform Module Registry, the version of the module is specified by tagging a release in the associated source code repository (e.g., GitHub). The version tag follows semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`), and Terraform uses these tags to identify and reference specific versions of the module.

Here’s how it works:

- **Version Tags:** You create and push a version tag in your version control system repository that contains the Terraform module. For example, if you’re using Git, you would create a tag like `v1.0.0` and push it to your repository.
  
- **Registry Integration:** The Terraform Module Registry picks up these tags from the repository and makes them available as versioned releases for users to select when using the module.

**Other Options:**

- **Configure it in the module's Terraform code:** Versioning is not specified in the module's Terraform code itself. The module code does not include versioning information that affects the registry.

- **Mention it on the module's configuration page on the Terraform Module Registry:** Versioning is not managed through the configuration page. The module registry uses version tags from the source repository.

- **The Terraform Module Registry does not support versioning modules:** This is incorrect as the Terraform Module Registry does support versioning of modules through repository tags.

### Summary

To specify a module's version when publishing it to the public Terraform Module Registry, you need to **tag a release in the associated repository**. This version tagging allows the module registry to track and offer specific versions of the module.
