# Defining Complex Input Variables in Terraform

## Question

You want to define a single input variable to capture configuration values for a server. The values must represent memory as a number, and the server name as a string. Which variable type could you use for this input?

- [ ] List
- [x] Object
- [ ] Map
- [ ] Terraform does not support complex input variables of different types

## Explanation

### List

**Explanation:** A list in Terraform is a collection of values of the same type, such as a list of strings or a list of numbers. Since you need to capture different types of values (a number and a string), a list is not suitable for this purpose.

### Object

**Explanation:** An **Object** is the appropriate variable type for capturing multiple values of different types. In this case, you can define an object variable with attributes for both memory (as a number) and server name (as a string). Here's how you can define it:

```hcl
variable "server_config" {
  type = object({
    memory     = number
    server_name = string
  })
}
