## Which command must you first run before performing further Terraform operations in a working directory?  

Before performing further Terraform operations in a working directory, you must first run the `terraform init` command. 

Here's what `terraform init` does:

- **Initializes the Working Directory**: Sets up the directory to be used by Terraform.
- **Downloads Provider Plugins**: Fetches the necessary provider plugins specified in your configuration files.
- **Configures the Backend**: Sets up the backend for storing the state file if you have defined a remote backend.
- **Prepares Modules**: If you use modules in your configuration, `terraform init` ensures they are correctly set up.

This command must be run once per project or whenever there are changes to the provider configurations or backends.

```sh
terraform init
```

Running this command prepares your working directory for other Terraform commands such as `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`, `terraform validate`, and `terraform destroy`.
