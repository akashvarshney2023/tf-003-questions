# Question and Answer: Valid Terraform Variable Types

## Question
Which of the following is **not** a valid Terraform variable type?

- [ ] `list`
- [ ] `array`
- [ ] `nap`
- [ ] `string`

## Answer

### **`list`**

**Explanation**:
In Terraform, `list` is a valid variable type. It represents a sequence of values, where each value can be of any type. For example, `list(string)` would be a valid declaration for a list of strings.

- [ ] **`list`**: Valid variable type.

### **`array`**

**Explanation**:
The term `array` is often used interchangeably with `list` in many programming contexts. However, in Terraform, `array` is not explicitly used as a type. Terraform uses `list` to represent a collection of values. Therefore, `array` as a standalone type is not recognized in Terraform.

- [x] **`array`**: Not a valid variable type.

### **`nap`**

**Explanation**:
`nap` is not a valid Terraform variable type. It is not recognized by Terraform and does not correspond to any of the supported data types such as `string`, `number`, `bool`, `list`, `map`, or `object`.

- [x] **`nap`**: Not a valid variable type.

### **`string`**

**Explanation**:
`string` is a valid variable type in Terraform. It represents a sequence of characters and is used for textual data. For instance, `variable "example" { type = string }` is a valid declaration for a string variable.

- [ ] **`string`**: Valid variable type.

## Summary

- **`list`**: Valid variable type.
- **`array`**: Not a valid variable type in Terraform.
- **`nap`**: Not a valid variable type.
- **`string`**: Valid variable type.

In Terraform, the recognized variable types include `string`, `number`, `bool`, `list`, `map`, and `object`. `array` and `nap` are not among the supported types.
