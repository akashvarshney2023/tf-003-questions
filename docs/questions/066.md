# Terraform Plan and Concurrent Manual Changes

## Question

You modified your Terraform configuration and ran `terraform plan` to review the changes. Simultaneously, your teammate manually modified the infrastructure component you are working on. Since you already ran `terraform plan` locally, the execution plan for `terraform apply` will be the same.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Explanation

**False**

**Explanation:** If your teammate manually modifies the infrastructure while you have a pending execution plan based on your local `terraform plan` output, the execution plan for `terraform apply` may differ from what was originally planned. This discrepancy arises because Terraform’s `terraform plan` command only shows a preview of changes based on the state at the time of the plan execution. If the actual state of the infrastructure changes (due to manual modifications or other actions), the state Terraform is working with will differ from the expected state.

Here’s what happens:

1. **Initial Plan:** When you run `terraform plan`, Terraform generates an execution plan based on the current state and the configuration at that moment.
2. **Manual Changes:** If manual changes are made to the infrastructure by someone else, these changes are not reflected in your local state or plan.
3. **Plan and Apply Discrepancy:** When you run `terraform apply`, Terraform compares the actual state of the infrastructure (which includes the manual changes) against the configuration and plan. As a result, the plan may no longer be accurate, and the actual changes applied might differ from what was initially planned.

**Other Considerations:**

- **State Refresh:** To handle such situations, it's a good practice to run `terraform refresh` or `terraform plan` again before `terraform apply` to ensure that the execution plan reflects the current state of the infrastructure.

### Summary

The execution plan for `terraform apply` will not necessarily be the same if manual changes have been made to the infrastructure after running `terraform plan`. The plan needs to be updated to reflect the latest state before applying changes.
