### Your security team scanned some Terraform workspaces and found secrets stored in plaintext in state files. How can you protect that data?

- Edit your state file to scrub out the sensitive data
- Always store your secrets in a secrets.tfvars file
- Delete the state file every time you run Terraform
- Store the state in an encrypted backend

---

To protect sensitive data stored in Terraform state files, the best approach is to:

**Store the state in an encrypted backend**

### Explanation:

- **Store the state in an encrypted backend**:
  - **Encryption**: Using an encrypted backend ensures that the Terraform state file is stored securely with encryption at rest. This means that even if unauthorized access to the backend occurs, the data remains protected by encryption.
  - **Backends like Azure Storage**: For example, in Azure, you can use the Azure Storage backend with encryption enabled. The storage service provides built-in encryption features to protect your data.

  ```hcl
  terraform {
    backend "azurerm" {
      resource_group_name  = "my-resource-group"
      storage_account_name = "mystorageaccount"
      container_name       = "terraform-state"
      key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
    }
  }
  ```

### Why Not the Other Options?

- **Edit your state file to scrub out the sensitive data**:
  - **Manual**: Manually editing state files is not recommended as it can be error-prone and complex. Terraform may not recognize changes if the state file is modified directly, leading to potential inconsistencies.

- **Always store your secrets in a secrets.tfvars file**:
  - **Sensitive Data**: While a `secrets.tfvars` file can be used to store sensitive variables, it should not be the primary method for protecting sensitive data. This file should be protected with proper file permissions, but it does not address the security of state files where sensitive data can still be exposed.

- **Delete the state file every time you run Terraform**:
  - **Practicality**: Deleting the state file is impractical and defeats the purpose of using Terraform, as the state file is crucial for tracking the current state of your infrastructure and planning changes. Without it, Terraform cannot effectively manage your infrastructure.

### Best Practices for Managing Sensitive Data in Terraform:

1. **Use Encrypted Backends**: Store Terraform state files in a backend that supports encryption at rest.
2. **Use Terraform Sensitive Variables**: Mark sensitive variables in your Terraform configurations to prevent them from being displayed in logs and outputs.

   ```hcl
   variable "db_password" {
     type      = string
     sensitive = true
   }
   ```

3. **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data like secrets in environment variables rather than in plaintext files.

By leveraging encrypted backends and following best practices, you can help ensure that sensitive data in Terraform state files is protected effectively.
