## Once you configure a new Terraform backend with a terraform code block, which command(s) should you use to migrate the state file?

- terraform destroy, then terraform apply
- terraform init
- terraform push
- terraform apply

---

Once you configure a new Terraform backend with a `terraform` block in your configuration, you should use the following command to migrate the state file to the new backend:

**`terraform init`**

### Explanation:

1. **`terraform init`**:
   - This command is used to initialize a new or existing Terraform working directory. When you configure a new backend, running `terraform init` is essential to set up the backend and migrate the state file to it.
   - During this initialization process, Terraform will detect the new backend configuration and prompt you to migrate the state to the new backend if it's different from the previous one.

### Why Not the Other Options?

- **`terraform destroy, then terraform apply`**:
  - This approach would destroy your existing infrastructure and then recreate it, which is not a suitable method for migrating state files. It would lead to loss of resources and data, which is not necessary for backend migration.

- **`terraform push`**:
  - The `terraform push` command is used to upload state files to a remote backend but is not a standard command in recent versions of Terraform. Backend migration is handled automatically during `terraform init`.

- **`terraform apply`**:
  - Running `terraform apply` applies changes to your infrastructure based on the current state but does not handle backend migration. You need to run `terraform init` to configure and migrate the state file to the new backend.

### Steps for Migrating the State File:

1. **Configure the new backend in your Terraform configuration file**:
   ```hcl
   terraform {
     backend "azurerm" {
       resource_group_name  = "my-resource-group"
       storage_account_name = "mystorageaccount"
       container_name       = "terraform-state"
       key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Run `terraform init`**:
   - This command will initialize the backend configuration and prompt you to migrate your state file to the new backend if necessary.

   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```

By running `terraform init`, Terraform will handle the migration of the state file to the new backend and ensure that the new backend is properly configured.
