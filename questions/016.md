### When should you write Terraform configuration files for existing infrastructure that you want to start managing with Terraform?

- You can import infrastructure without corresponding Terraform code
- Terraform will generate the corresponding configuration files for you
- **Before you run `terraform import`**
- After you run `terraform import`
---

### Correct Answer:
**Before you run `terraform import`**

### Here's why:

- **Before you run `terraform import`**: 
  - Terraform needs the configuration for the resources you want to import already defined. This ensures that Terraform knows how to represent and manage the imported resources within its state.

### Why Not the Other Options?

- **You can import infrastructure without corresponding Terraform code**:
  - This is incorrect. Terraform requires configuration code to know how to manage the imported resources.

- **Terraform will generate the corresponding configuration files for you**:
  - Terraform does not automatically generate configuration files for existing resources. You need to manually write these configuration files.

- **After you run `terraform import`**:
  - This is incorrect because Terraform needs the configuration in place to correctly import and map the existing resources to the state.

### Correct Process in Azure Context:

1. **Write the Terraform configuration files** for the existing resources.
2. **Run `terraform import`** to map the existing resources to the configurations you've defined.

#### Example:

1. Write the configuration file (e.g., `main.tf`):
   ```hcl
   provider "azurerm" {
     features {}
   }

   resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "example" {
     name                  = "example-vm"
     location              = "West Europe"
     resource_group_name   = "example-resources"
     network_interface_ids = ["${azurerm_network_interface.example.id}"]
     vm_size               = "Standard_DS1_v2"

     storage_os_disk {
       name              = "example-os-disk"
       caching           = "ReadWrite"
       create_option     = "FromImage"
       managed_disk_type = "Standard_LRS"
     }

     os_profile {
       computer_name  = "hostname"
       admin_username = "adminuser"
       admin_password = "Password1234!"
     }

     os_profile_linux_config {
       disable_password_authentication = false
     }

     source_image_reference {
       publisher = "Canonical"
       offer     = "UbuntuServer"
       sku       = "18.04-LTS"
       version   = "latest"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Run the `terraform import` command:
   ```sh
   terraform import azurerm_virtual_machine.example /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vmName}
   ```

By following this process, Terraform will correctly map the existing Azure infrastructure to the defined resources in the configuration files, allowing you to manage them using Terraform.
