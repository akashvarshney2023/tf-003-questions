### What does the default "local" Terraform backend store?

- tfplan files
- State file
- Provider plugins
- Terraform binary

---

The default "local" Terraform backend stores the **state file**.

### Explanation:
- **tfplan files**: These are generated during the `terraform plan` command and are not stored in the backend.
- **State file**: The local backend stores the state file locally on the disk. This file keeps track of the resources managed by Terraform, their attributes, and their relationships.
- **Provider plugins**: These are downloaded and stored in the `.terraform` directory within the project directory but are not part of the backend storage.
- **Terraform binary**: The Terraform binary is the executable used to run Terraform commands and is not stored in the backend.

### Default "local" Backend
By default, Terraform uses the local backend, which stores the state file on the local disk in a file named `terraform.tfstate`.

### Example
When you initialize a Terraform project without specifying a remote backend, Terraform will store the state file in the current working directory:

```plaintext
$ ls
main.tf  terraform.tfstate
```

Therefore, the correct answer is **State file**.
