### You have provisioned some virtual machines (VMs) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the gcloud command line tool. However, you are standardizing with Terraform and want to manage these VMs using Terraform instead. What are the two things you must do to achieve this? Choose two correct answers.


- Run the terraform Import-gcp command
- Write Terraform configuration for the existing VMs
- Use the terraform import command for the existing VMs
- Provision new VMs using Terraform with the same VM names
--- 

To manage the existing VMs provisioned using the gcloud command line tool with Terraform, you need to:

1. **Write Terraform configuration for the existing VMs**
2. **Use the `terraform import` command for the existing VMs**

Here's a detailed explanation of the steps involved:

1. **Write Terraform configuration for the existing VMs**:
   - You need to create Terraform configuration files (e.g., `.tf` files) that define the desired state of your existing VMs. These configurations should match the current state of the VMs as closely as possible, including resource names, types, properties, and any other relevant settings.

2. **Use the `terraform import` command for the existing VMs**:
   - The `terraform import` command is used to bring existing infrastructure under Terraform management. This command maps the existing GCP VM instances to the resources defined in your Terraform configuration.
   - For example, you would run a command like:
     ```sh
     terraform import google_compute_instance.my_instance <instance_id>
     ```
   - This command imports the existing GCP VM instance with the specified instance ID into the Terraform state file, associating it with the `google_compute_instance.my_instance` resource defined in your configuration.

### Why Not the Other Options?

- **Run the terraform Import-gcp command**:
  - There is no `terraform Import-gcp` command. The correct command to use is `terraform import`.

- **Provision new VMs using Terraform with the same VM names**:
  - Provisioning new VMs with the same names is not the goal. You want to manage the existing VMs with Terraform, not create new ones.

By writing the Terraform configuration for the existing VMs and using the `terraform import` command, you can bring your existing infrastructure under Terraform management without recreating any resources.
